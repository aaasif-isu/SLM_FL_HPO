A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal for such tasks based on common practices. Weight decay is important for regularization, and I will set it at 1e-05 to prevent overfitting without being too aggressive, as the initial training phase often requires some latitude for learning. The momentum of 0.9 provides a sensible balance improving convergence speed while allowing some inertia in gradients. For the optimizer, 'Adam' is chosen for its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be particularly beneficial in early training phases. In terms of scheduling, using 'None' allows the learning rate to remain constant in the first run, which is a safer approach. For the number of local epochs, setting it to 2 aligns well with the need to adequately train on a medium-resource client. A batch size of 32 was selected, as this is a moderate size that accommodates both processing capacity and learning efficiency. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.25 is introduced to help mitigate potential overfitting during the initial epochs. On the server side, I maintain the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for consistency in training across the federated model, and I recommend using 'Adam' for its adaptive nature in managing global model updates. The learning rate on the server will also be static by opting for 'None' as the scheduler, thus facilitating a straightforward global training process.

I will set local_epochs to 2, allowing for enough passes over the dataset without straining the client’s capacity. A batch size of 24 will be used to optimize memory usage while training. Finally, I will slightly increase the dropout rate to 0.3, given the moderately high training accuracy compared to the test accuracy, to mitigate any potential overfitting. For the server, I recommend a learning rate of 0.001, which has been effective thus far and is within the valid range. The server's momentum will also remain consistent at 0.9 with AdamW as the optimizer and StepLR as the learning rate schedule to allow for future adaptations. The mu value is set at 0.05, providing regularization strength without being too restrictive on the local updates."}}

I also keep local_epochs to a modest 2 to balance between training time and model convergence while using a dropout_rate of 0.2 based on peer strategies which may help prevent overfitting. For the server, maintaining a similar approach with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 will provide a good base for the federated setup, while using 'AdamW' for optimizing server-side updates. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, as it’s a reasonable initial regularization factor that has shown effective performance in previous federated learning experiments."}}

Regarding weight decay, the previous configuration used a value of 0.0001, which I will keep the same to prevent over-regularization. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it has stabilized the training well in past attempts. The optimizer will continue to be Adam, given its robustness in training deep networks. The scheduler will be set to 'None', as experimentation didn't reveal any improvements with it so far. The local epochs will be kept at 2 since this has allowed sufficient training iterations without exceeding resource constraints. I will lower the batch size to 8 to better accommodate the limitations of the client capacity. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3, as a higher dropout can help mitigate potential overfitting issues while conforming to the constraints. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 to maintain stability, with the same optimizer as the client. The scheduler will also be left as 'None' due to identified non-benefits. Finally, 'mu' will be set to 0.01, within the range specified, as there was previously no indication that changing it would yield significant benefits."}}

Since the client is high-resource, I will use the maximum batch size of 256 for better resource utilization. To combat potential overfitting, increasing the weight_decay to 0.0007 is reasonable. The momentum remains at 0.9, as it's a well-established value in similar tasks. The dropout rate will be moderately increased to 0.4 to provide further regularization. The scheduler will remain as 'CosineAnnealingLR' for better learning rate adjustments. The server's parameters will similarly stay close, but I will align the server's learning rate at 0.001 for consistency across federated learning. The mu value will be set at 0.01, in line with the previous round's use and peer performance."}}

Increasing it to 0.0005 can help mitigate overfitting. The momentum will be retained at 0.9, a midpoint providing stability in optimization. I've opted for the SGD optimizer for its simplicity and effectiveness in training CNNs. For client-side dropout_rate, I will increase it to 0.3 to prevent overfitting further, as the previous value of 0.2 seemed ineffective and was below the halfway mark. The local_epochs will remain at 2, which is consistent and provides a balanced approach to training iterations without placing too much load on a medium-resource client. The batch_size will be set to 32 to facilitate quicker iterations and should be manageable within the client's capacity. For server-side parameters, I will use the same learning_rate of 0.001 with the momentum set at 0.9 to maintain coherence with the client's configuration. The optimizer will remain as SGD, and I will use 'None' for the scheduler to simplify adjustments without additional complexities. Finally, the mu parameter will stay at 0.01 to ensure regularization in the federated scheme is effective without being over-constraining."}}

Considering I am not aware of the dataset behavior for the client yet, I will suggest a local_epochs of 2.0 as it seems to be a balanced choice among peers.

The previous learning rates of 0.001 and 0.0015 have shown reasonable results, with 0.0015 achieving a slightly lower test accuracy. Therefore, I suggest using a learning rate of 0.0013, which is a more conservative choice within the allowed range to mitigate any fluctuations. Weight decay should be slightly increased to 0.0002 to help with potential overfitting, while keeping momentum at 0.9 for stability. I will choose 'AdamW' as the optimizer because it has been effective in the client's history. Considering the capacity of Cluster 2, I will increase the batch size to 256 for better performance while retaining the dropout rate at 0.2 for regularization against overfitting. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 with 'AdamW' as the optimizer since these settings are yielding good results across client peers. The mu value will be maintained at 0.01 to ensure consistency in federated training."}}

Given that 'Client 264' saw better results with a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0005, I will keep this learning rate for consistency and potential stability in training. However, to address any potential overfitting (as seen in previous runs), I will slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0003, which is still within the allowed range and could help regularize the model further. The chosen optimizer remains 'Adam' due to its strong performance in previous epochs. I will also increase the dropout rate to 0.4 (from 0.3) as a preventive measure against overfitting, given the high-capacity cluster's ability to manage this. For the batch size, I'll use 128, which balances efficiency and performance. Lastly, I will keep the server-side learning rate consistent at 0.001 with the 'Adam' optimizer, which has proven effective, while increasing mu to 0.02, aligning with a peer's approach who achieved slightly better performance with a similar structure. Maintaining these adjustments aligns strategy with history while adhering strictly to constraint ranges."}}

I will select a lower learning rate of 0.001, as it has been used successfully in previous configurations. Weight decay of 0.0003 will be maintained, as it has positively contributed without explicit signs of overfitting in previous epochs. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW,' consistent with successful peer usage. I am also increasing the dropout rate to 0.3, which has been beneficial in peer Client 152's results. Given the client's high-resource capabilities, I will increase the batch size to 256 to leverage more parallel computing power. Local epochs will remain at 2 to foster a balance between speed and convergence. For the server parameters, the learning rate will remain at 0.001, following the consistency shown in test scores. I will keep using 'AdamW' optimizer on the server side, accompanied by 'None' for the scheduler, to minimize complexity. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01 as observed in recent successful setups, which has shown balance in federated learning performance."}}
