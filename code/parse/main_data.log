To address this, I will increase the learning rate slightly closer to the maximum allowed within constraints, which would allow for potentially faster convergence and improved performance. Setting `learning_rate` to 0.0005 aligns with avoiding issues faced by low-resource clients since it is at the upper limit of what's permissible, but still small enough for stable training. Regarding `weight_decay`, while it helps with overfitting, the model did not show signs of overfitting yet, thus I will keep it relatively low at 0.0001. The dropout rate is already at a standard 0.2; maintaining this should help maintain a balance between regularization and learning capacity. For the number of local epochs, I will select 2 to ensure the model trains effectively without overwhelming the low-resource capacity of the client. I will choose a batch size of 16 as it is within constraints and allows for efficient gradient updates considering the low-resource context. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' for its balance of performance and stability, which is especially beneficial in these environments. Moving to the server parameters, I will maintain the same learning rate and momentum values to ensure consistency in training dynamics across clients and the server, utilizing the same optimizer ('AdamW') since it is a good fit for federated learning setups.

I suggest setting the learning rate to 0.001, which is a mid-range choice that is less likely to cause instability during training, aligning with the client's capacity. For weight decay, I will set it to 0.0001 to help with regularization, but not too high to avoid further complicating the learning process for a weak client. The momentum is set to 0.9, as this value is a commonly accepted default that aids in smoother convergence. I will choose the 'SGD' optimizer as it often performs better in situations with limited resources compared to AdamW and offers better control over training dynamics. The scheduler is set to 'None' as we are starting anew, which helps avoid complexity. For local epochs, I will choose 2 to provide adequate training time without overwhelming the client. The batch size is set to 16, as smaller batches are more manageable for low-resource clients. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.3 is introduced, as a moderate dropout can help prevent potential overfitting issues without overly restricting the model’s capacity to learn. For the server, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum with SGD for consistency and stability across clients, and since the client is weak, the scheduler will remain 'None'.

Choosing a lower learning rate of 0.0005 balances exploration and convergence.

The optimizer 'SGD' will be retained as it is generally effective for ResNet models. I will keep the momentum at 0.9, which is proven to be a good choice historically. The local epochs will remain at 2 and the batch size at 32 since they provide a good balance between learning stability and resource use.

A momentum of 0.9 is a standard choice that helps accelerate gradients in the relevant direction, improving convergence speed. For the optimizer, AdamW is selected for its effective performance on image classification tasks, managing weights well by decoupling weight decay from the gradient updates.

I noticed from the client's history that a learning rate of 0.0005 was used, but it is outside the strict constraints. Therefore, I will choose the highest possible value within the limits, which is 0.0003. This provides a sufficiently high learning rate that is still conservative. The weight_decay will be set to 1e-05, the lowest value available, to minimize regularization initially, as there is no indication of overfitting from previous results. Momentum will remain at 0.9, which aligns with the peer history and is a commonly effective value for momentum. For the optimizer, I will also use 'Adam', consistent with the client’s history to promote stability. The local_epochs will be set to 2 as this matches the client's previous setting with reasonable local training while limiting conflict from overfitting. The batch_size will be 16, which is the only option given the constraints that the client can handle. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.2 was previously used, and this value is reasonable to start with, as it balances between allowing the model to learn patterns and preventing overfitting. For the server, I will use a slightly higher learning_rate of 0.001 (the maximum allowed) to increase the global learning capacity while retaining stability. The momentum for the server will also be 0.9, and I will stick with 'Adam' as the optimizer for consistency and performance.

A moderate learning_rate (0.001) is a good start for image classification tasks to allow for effective training without overshooting minima.

    "reasoning": "The client's last test accuracy was 65.97%, which suggests room for improvement could be achieved through tuning hyperparameters. Since the training accuracy isn't provided, we can hypothesize that a higher learning rate would help if underfitting is occurring due to the relatively moderate test accuracy. However, given the strict constraints, I will utilize the highest learning rate option at 0.0005, which is still conservative relative to the usual settings. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 helps in regularizing the model, which may mitigate potential overfitting, especially considering that ResNet models generally need such regularization. For optimization, 'AdamW' remains a suitable choice given the client historically used it and has likely benefitted from its adaptive learning capability. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 to maintain stability in learning. The dropout rate is set to 0.4, which offers a good balance for regularizing the model while allowing it to learn complex features. The batch size of 24 is chosen as it lies within the constraints and balances training time with resource use. The server's configuration will mirror the client's choices where applicable, using a learning rate of 0.001 to ensure steady global learning. I will use the 'StepLR' scheduler to adjust learning rates in a way that can stabilize convergence over many epochs.

The chosen learning rate of 0.001 is at the high end of the acceptable range, and further increases could lead to instability, especially given the medium-resource capacity. To combat potential overfitting (if high train accuracy were evident), we could consider increasing the weight decay to support regularization; I'll set it to 0.0005 to see if it helps in improving generalization. I'll also moderate the learning rate to 0.0005, which is within constraints and might help improve stability and convergence. Given that the batch size of 64 was previously used, it remains within the acceptable space for medium-resource clients, allowing for manageable gradient updates. The dropout rate remains at the lower bound of 0.1 to facilitate learning without significant reduction in capacity. For local epochs, I will maintain it at 2, which allows sufficient training without overloading the client's resources. For the server, I suggest the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate also of 0.001, consistent with the client to ensure convergence alignment without increasing complexity.

Given that the client is in a low-resource cluster, I need to select hyperparameters that ensure stable training. Therefore, I will set the `learning_rate` on the lower end of the spectrum at 0.001 to help with stability. The `weight_decay` will be set relatively low (1e-05) to mitigate overfitting without overly restricting learning capacity since I have no previous accuracy metrics to judge over/underfitting. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, which is often effective for gradient updates. The optimizer will be 'SGD' as it generally works better with low-resource situations compared to others. For scheduling, I will use 'None' since there is no previous data to warrant a more complex schedule. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2, balancing between training time and convergence. The `batch_size` will be set to 16 to ensure that training remains manageable on the client's resources. Lastly, I will use a `dropout_rate` of 0.1, which is a conservative approach to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity. For the server, I will keep the `learning_rate` at 0.001, `momentum` at 0.9, and `optimizer` as 'SGD' as well, without any scheduler for simplicity.

The `weight_decay` is set at 1e-04 to apply some regularization given that higher values could be necessary if we see indications of overfitting in the future. Given the relatively moderate capacity of the client, I will choose a `batch_size` of 32, which strikes a balance between training stability and resource limitations without exceeding the peak capabilities.

For image classification using ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, the choice of optimizer plays a crucial role. I will use 'AdamW' as it is often effective for image tasks, particularly for stabilizing training. Setting the learning rate to 0.001 balances the initial exploration—this rate is neither too high (which could cause divergence) nor too low (which may slow convergence). A weight decay of 0.0001 will help regularize the model but still allow it to learn effectively. With a moderate momentum of 0.9, it should facilitate convergence. For local epochs, choosing 2 offers a good compromise between training time and model performance given the medium resources. A batch size of 64 is efficient and appropriate for the cluster's capabilities. Lastly, I will set the dropout rate to 0.1 to help mitigate overfitting while still allowing the model to learn intricate features in the images. For the server, a similar approach will be taken; the learning rate and optimizer match the client to maintain consistency in training dynamics, with a momentum of 0.9.

To address potential overfitting, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 5e-05 to help regularize the model without destabilizing the training process. Given that the client's capacity is low-resource, I will slightly lower the `learning_rate` to 0.0005 to ensure training is stable; it's at the higher end allowed which should help with underfitting. The choice of `Adam` as the optimizer is based on the fact that it adapts the learning rate during training, which can be beneficial in a low-resource setup. Maintaining a `momentum` of 0.9 should help accelerate SGD in the relevant directions. The `local_epochs` will be kept to 2 since it's a reasonable number for balancing between convergence and resource constraints. The `batch_size` is set to 16, which is viable for clients with limited resources. Lastly, the `dropout_rate` is maintained at 0.2 to provide some regularization but not too much, ensuring the model continues to learn effectively. For the server parameters, I will use a learning rate of 0.001 as it is a common choice that balances stability and convergence in federated settings. The `momentum` is also set to 0.9 to keep consistency with the client's approach. Using `AdamW` for optimization at the server level reflects good performance in similar tasks.

Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.3 is chosen to provide regularization without significantly hampering model learning.\n\nFor the server parameters, I maintained a learning rate of 0.001, which is consistent with that of the client, providing stability across updates. The momentum remains at 0.9 and uses 'Adam' for its optimizer to ensure coherence in client-server updates.

This suggests an underfitting situation if the training metrics were assumed to be higher (which often is a safe assumption for initial benchmarks). To improve learning, I will increase the learning_rate to its maximum value of 0.0005, since a higher learning rate often helps correct underfitting by allowing the model to learn more quickly from the data. For weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0005, as having a slight regularization can prevent overfitting while maintaining capacity to learn. The optimizer remains as 'Adam', which has generally performed well in similar architectures. I will also keep the momentum at 0.9 as it is a common choice for stability without being too aggressive. The batch size will remain at 64, which is manageable for medium-resource clients like this one. The dropout_rate is also increased to 0.3, slightly reducing the model's capacity to help with regularization while avoiding overfitting.

I will use 'AdamW' for its adaptive learning capabilities, which are beneficial in complex models like ResNet. For the learning_rate, I'll choose 0.001, which is a standard starting point that balances convergence and stability, falling into the recommended range without being too aggressive. For weight_decay, I'll apply a value of 0.0001 to introduce some regularization without overwhelming the model, as no evidence of overfitting has been collected yet. The momentum will be set at 0.9, which is commonly used to speed up convergence in deep learning. I'll choose a batch_size of 64, as the client is high-resource and can handle larger batches effectively, helping the model learn better. I will also include a dropout_rate of 0.25, as it systematically helps to prevent overfitting while allowing sufficient capacity to learn. For the server parameters, I'll align with the client learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, also using 'AdamW' for consistency and stability in training.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for this client and no performance history is available, I have opted for conservative hyperparameters. Given that the client operates on a low-resource cluster, a smaller `batch_size` of 8 is suitable to ensure stable training. For `learning_rate`, I selected 0.001, which is within the recommended range and should provide a stable start without risking the instability that can occur with high learning rates. A `weight_decay` of 0.0001 is appropriate to introduce light regularization, but not too much, as we don't have previous accuracy data indicating overfitting. For `momentum`, I chose 0.9, which is a standard value helping to speed up convergence while maintaining stability. The `optimizer` is set to 'Adam' because it generally performs well in image classification tasks, particularly when resources are limited. I have chosen `StepLR` as the scheduler for its simplicity and effectiveness, as it may help adjust the learning rate dynamically. The `local_epochs` is set to 2, which balances the need for training while being considerate of resource constraints. Finally, I set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to prevent potential overfitting without impacting learning significantly. \n\nFor the server parameters, I used the same `learning_rate` of 0.001 and `momentum` of 0.9, with the same 'Adam' optimizer for consistency across client and server. The scheduler remains 'None' for simplicity in this initial run. The `mu` value is set to 0.01, which allows for a moderate level of regularization in the federated context, promoting stability while allowing for contribution." ,

The guidance emphasizes the importance of the learning rate and optimizer choice. Since the client operates in a High-Resource setup, we can afford to use more aggressive settings. I opted for a learning rate of 0.001 which is moderate and should favor good convergence without risking instability. For the optimizer, I chose 'Adam' because it generally performs well in image classification tasks like CIFAR-10. The weight decay is set at 1e-04 to introduce some regularization without overly constraining the model's capacity. A momentum of 0.9 will help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, allowing for faster convergence. I selected a batch size of 64, which is suitable for high-resource clients, as larger batches can lead to more stable gradients. For dropout rate, I set it to 0.2 to help cushion against overfitting while allowing enough model capacity. The local epochs are set to 2 to allow for ample training while still fitting within limited communication rounds. For the server settings, I'm keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and using the 'Adam' optimizer with no scheduler, simplifying the training process at this stage. Lastly, I set mu to 0.01 to introduce regularization during federated learning without overpowering the client learning rate.",

However, considering the model is a ResNet18 applied to a cifar10 image classification task, I recommend a moderate learning rate to ensure stable training without overshooting. A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal for such tasks based on common practices. Weight decay is important for regularization, and I will set it at 1e-05 to prevent overfitting without being too aggressive, as the initial training phase often requires some latitude for learning. The momentum of 0.9 provides a sensible balance improving convergence speed while allowing some inertia in gradients. For the optimizer, 'Adam' is chosen for its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be particularly beneficial in early training phases. In terms of scheduling, using 'None' allows the learning rate to remain constant in the first run, which is a safer approach. For the number of local epochs, setting it to 2 aligns well with the need to adequately train on a medium-resource client. A batch size of 32 was selected, as this is a moderate size that accommodates both processing capacity and learning efficiency. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.25 is introduced to help mitigate potential overfitting during the initial epochs. On the server side, I maintain the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for consistency in training across the federated model, and I recommend using 'Adam' for its adaptive nature in managing global model updates. The learning rate on the server will also be static by opting for 'None' as the scheduler, thus facilitating a straightforward global training process.

Since this rate is already effective, I will suggest lowering the learning rate slightly to 0.0005 to ensure stability and avoid fluctuations in performance, as per the guidance for optimal learning rates in cases of achieving reasonable accuracy. The weight decay will be increased from 0.0001 to 0.0005 to enhance regularization, which can help mitigate any potential overfitting observed since training accuracy may be relatively high. The optimizer 'AdamW' has proven effective for the client, so I will retain this choice. A momentum of 0.9 is optimal as per prior usage and lies within the specified range. The batch size of 64 is retained, as Cluster 2 can handle it well. I will set the dropout rate to 0.3; this is within the effective range and can aid in reducing overfitting.

This rate strikes a balance for starting the training process without being too aggressive, which could lead to instability. As the guidance suggests higher weight decay can help with overfitting, I will set the weight_decay to 0.0005 to introduce regularization without being too restrictive. The momentum will be set to 0.9, which is a proven value commonly used for CNNs and helps expedite convergence. I will choose the Adam optimizer due to its adaptive learning rate properties, which are beneficial for image classification tasks like this one. A scheduler is not required for the initial round, so I will set 'None' for the scheduler. For local epochs, 2 epochs is a good choice since starting with a moderate number allows for finding a reasonable amount of performance before fine-tuning based on results. The batch size of 64 is appropriate for high-resource clients, allowing for better updates while maintaining a balance in memory usage. Lastly, I will set a dropout rate of 0.2, which is a conservative approach to reduce overfitting potential while still allowing the model to learn effectively.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round, we will take a conservative approach by selecting hyperparameters that have shown success in similar contexts. Notably, client 238 achieved an accuracy of 76.84% with a configuration that included a learning rate of 0.0001, which is on the low end, indicating that lower learning rates may work better for low-resource clients like Client 358. Therefore, we will also choose a learning rate of 0.0001 to ensure stable training. For weight_decay, I will select a value of 0.0003 as it aligns with the peer's strategy and helps in regularization even though we don't have direct overfitting indications yet. A momentum of 0.9 is common practice for SGD and will help in model convergence. I will choose 'SGD' as the optimizer as peers have successfully leveraged it, and I'll select 'StepLR' for the scheduler to adapt the learning rate during training. For local_epochs, setting it to 2 will provide sufficient training while keeping the client resources in mind. The batch_size will be set to 16 to accommodate low-resource constraints and balance throughputs. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.35 aligns with common practices for CNNs like ResNet and helps to minimize overfitting risks. For the server, I will replicate the learning rate of 0.001 from peer history since it worked well without introducing instability in federated settings, still using SGD and 'None' for scheduler as the defaults to keep it simple.

However, to ensure stable training on a low-resource client, I will suggest a lower learning rate. Therefore, I recommend a learning rate of 0.0001, which is at the lower bound of the acceptable range. Additionally, the client should stick with the existing weight decay of 0.0003, as it has helped control overfitting in previous iterations. The learning rate and weight decay are within the appropriate ranges for ensuring stability in training on low-resource devices. A momentum of 0.9 is appropriate and consistent with previous setups as it can help accelerate SGD in the relevant direction. Keeping the optimizer as SGD is a good choice as it has been used successfully in prior configurations, thus continuity is essential. The dropout rate of 0.35 was effective previously, and will help in reducing overfitting while not increasing it beyond the current level. The local epochs are set to 2 as this value has previously proven effective without overconsuming client resources. The batch size is kept at 16 since it is the same as the client's past settings and fits within the low-resource constraints. For the server, I will maintain the server learning rate at 0.001 since it has been consistent in yielding acceptable performance.

A learning rate of 0.0005 is close to the upper boundary but sensible for moderate training. I will also keep weight decay at 0.0001 to control overfitting, as moving to a higher value is unnecessary without signs of severe overfitting, especially with the current test accuracy.

The current learning rate of 0.001 is at the higher end of the allowed range; however, since this led to a somewhat low test accuracy compared to expectations, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0005 to allow for more gradual convergence. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 will help combat overfitting as the client's test accuracy is not optimal. The choice of momentum remains at 0.9, consistent with the previous successful trials. The 'AdamW' optimizer will be retained for its adaptive learning capabilities, which are beneficial for image classification tasks. A dropout rate of 0.3 was previously successful; to further improve regularization, I will maintain that rate since it is already yielding good results. The batch size of 64 is optimal for the client's capability while remaining consistent with prior runs. The server configuration will also align with the client's learning rate, maintaining it at 0.0005 for consistency across the federation. The choice of 'AdamW' on the server is kept to maintain optimally adaptive learning behavior, and the scheduler will be set to 'None', allowing for a more straightforward training regime. The FedProx regularization term `mu` will be set to the maximum of 0.01 to provide strong regularization benefits given the client's high-resource context.

This indicates that the hyperparameters have been somewhat effective but may still be optimized further. Since the learning rate used in earlier epochs (0.001) was too high for optimal performance, and the current learning rate (0.0005) seems close to its maximum threshold, I suggest reducing the learning rate to 0.0003, which is just under the recently effective value but remains well within the allowed range. This will slow down the learning process slightly, allowing more careful convergence on relevant features in the data. \n\nThe weight decay is currently at 0.0005, which helps regularization. However, to mitigate any potential overfitting issues observed in the past (noted by the difference in accuracies), I propose increasing the weight decay to 0.001 to enhance regularization further.\n\nThe dropout rate currently set at 0.1 seemed insufficient as evidenced by the results from peer 485 (0.4). To address possible overfitting and improve generalization, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.2, which should help balance training without overly hampering learning.\n\nThe other hyperparameters such as momentum (0.9), optimizer (AdamW), and local epochs (2) remain appropriate given their consistency with successful configurations in peer setups. I will keep the batch size at 64, as it fits the client's medium-resource capacity while allowing effective training. \n\nOn the server side, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001, as it remains effective for relevant stakeholders and is consistent with the past configurations. I will also retain the optimizer (AdamW) and momentum (0.9) for server settings, as they have proven effective.

Clients 485 and 123 both achieved high accuracies using `learning_rate` of 0.0005, `weight_decay` of 0.0005, and the `AdamW` optimizer. This choice is safe and aligns with common practices for image classification tasks where lower rates might be needed to start. The momentum is set to 0.9, which has been effectively used by peers and helps in stabilizing updates. For batch_size, I will select 32—this is a middle ground that has performed well in seen configurations, supporting both efficient training and reasonable convergence speed. A dropout rate of 0.4 is employed given that peer clients have effectively used higher dropout rates due to the potential of overfitting in image classification tasks, particularly on vibrant and diverse datasets like CIFAR-10. For the server-side, I will mirror the client's settings closely to maintain consistency in learning rates and optimization dynamics, selecting a learning rate of 0.001 to allow for broader exploration while keeping the learning rate range reasonable.

A weight decay of 0.0001 will provide some regularization without being too aggressive, as we do not have information indicating overfitting. Momentum will be set to 0.9, which is generally effective for convergence in image models, and I will use the AdamW optimizer as it typically performs well in image classification tasks. For the learning policy, 'CosineAnnealingLR' will be adopted to allow the learning rate to adaptively decrease, which is beneficial for image training setups. I will set 'local_epochs' to 3 as this is a high-resource client, allowing for sufficient training without being excessive. A batch size of 64 will leverage the client's capabilities and provide a sufficient number of examples per training iteration. Finally, I'll set a dropout rate of 0.3, which strikes a balance between training efficiency and overfitting prevention. On the server side, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum values; using AdamW optimizer and a scheduler of 'None' for simplicity, at least until a pattern emerges in performance metrics. I will set mu to 0.01 as it is a middle-ground value that aids with regularization without being overly constraining.",

Thus, I choose a `learning_rate` of 0.001, which is within the middle of the scale and allows for effective learning.

Given no previous runs, a moderate `momentum` of 0.9 is selected to facilitate telling the optimizer about the previous gradients, helping smooth gradients leading to convergence. For the `optimizer`, I choose 'Adam' as it is generally robust and effective for a variety of tasks, particularly image classification. The `scheduler` is set to 'None' to keep the training straightforward as this is the first time running and it would benefit from a consistent learning rate.

This indicates that while training accuracy is likely solid (not confirmed), there are signs that overfitting may be occurring. Therefore, we will adjust hyperparameters to moderate this risk. We'll maintain a relatively low learning_rate of 0.0005 to ensure smooth training, as both accuracies show less than ideal improvement when moved higher. To combat overfitting, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to its upper limit of 0.0002, as higher regularization may help to reduce overfitting. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, continuing to allow for effective optimization. The optimizer stays on 'AdamW' as it has been successful historically. Since the batch_size options are limited and 32 isn't available, we'll select 24 as a reasonable alternative, ensuring we adhere to resource constraints and leaving headroom for computational efficiency. We'll also retain dropout_rate at 0.3 to further help with possible overfitting while staying below the maximum cap. For the server parameters, the learning_rate remains at 0.001 which is within a safe operational window conducive to collaboration during federated training. The momentum isn’t modified and remains at 0.9, along with using 'AdamW' for the server's optimization to mirror the client for consistency in performance.

Given this is the client's first round, we have no prior training history to analyze but must proceed with cautious choices tailored to their constraints. The learning_rate is suggested at 0.001, which is midway in the range, allowing for stable convergence. The weight_decay is set to 1e-04 to facilitate some regularization without being excessively penalizing for a low-resource setup. The momentum is chosen at 0.9 to help with smoother convergence in a potentially noisy training environment. The optimizer 'AdamW' is selected due to its adaptive learning rate properties, which often yield better performance in image classification tasks. For the learning schedule, 'None' is chosen as over-complicating the training process may not be beneficial for this client type. The local_epochs is set to 2, balancing training time and performance enhancement. The batch_size is set to 16, a smaller size suitable for low-resources clients, which can help manage memory usage. Finally, the dropout_rate is defined at 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting. For the server-side parameters, an identical learning_rate of 0.001 aligns the server's training process with the clients, while using the same momentum and optimizer promotes consistency across the system. The scheduler remains 'None' for similar logic. The mu value is chosen at 0.01, allowing for effective regularization in the federated scheme without being overly restrictive.",

    "reasoning": "Since this is the client's first round, we should select conservative parameters to ensure stability in training due to their low-resource capacity. The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is in the middle of the allowed range to provide a good balance between stability and learning capability. Considering the nature of image classification tasks and the guidance that suggests lower learning rates for high overfitting risk or when addressing low-resource scenarios, this is a safe starting point. For weight decay, a value of 1e-04 is chosen to apply a small regularization effect, which is suitable given that the task is prone to overfitting. The momentum of 0.9 is typical for momentum-based optimizers and should help accelerate SGD in certain directions during training. For the optimizer, 'SGD' is chosen as it is generally more stable and performs well with less computational resources compared to 'Adam' or 'AdamW'. A local_epochs value of 1 is selected because the client is low-resource, thus limiting computational demands. A batch_size of 16 is also moderately small, which aligns with the client’s capacity, ensuring they can process the data without overwhelming their resources. The dropout_rate is set to 0.2 to help mitigate potential overfitting without severely impacting learning. For the server, consistency is key; thus, the same learning_rate and optimizer choices are made as the client, alongside a momentum of 0.9 for the reasons previously discussed. Finally, the mu parameter is set to 0.01 to provide some level of regularization in the Federated scheme, which is within the prescribed range.

Based on guidance, since the client's training accuracy is likely higher than the test accuracy, this indicates a potential for overfitting. Therefore, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.4 to help with regularization, while maintaining the initial learning rate (0.001) as it falls within the suggested range. The weight decay will also be slightly increased to 0.0005 to introduce more regularization and reduce overfitting. Given the client's high-resource capabilities, I will set the batch size to 128, allowing for more efficient training. I will keep the local epochs at 2, as it balances between training time and convergence rates. On the server side, I will use the same learning rate and optimizer as the client to maintain consistency, choosing the scheduler as 'None' to avoid complications from dynamic learning rate adjustments.

Given that we are considering improving upon this result and operating in a high-resource environment, we can afford to be slightly more aggressive with the hyperparameters. We will select a learning rate slightly higher than the previous one to potentially improve training dynamics while remaining within the specified constraints. Setting the learning rate to 0.0005 is supported by the guidance that a higher learning rate can help when both test and train accuracies are low. We will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' for its effective performance in most image classification tasks. The momentum will remain at 0.9, aligning with the client’s history, as there is no evidence against its effectiveness. We will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 to help mitigate any potential overfitting, as we want to ensure our model generalizes better to new data. The batch_size is set to 64, which is consistent with the previous run and is manageable within the client’s high-resource parameters. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is chosen to further regularize the network, responding to the potential risk of overfitting due to the complexity of the ResNet18 architecture.\n\nFor server parameters, we'll match the client's optimizer and momentum values with 'AdamW' and 0.9. For the learning rate, we will set it slightly lower than the client's to ensure stable global training dynamics, at 0.0003, remaining well within the allowed range. For the scheduler, we will opt for 'None' to keep the process straightforward and consistent with the client's past use.

Therefore, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0005, which is the higher end of the allowed range but within the thresholds for low-resource clients. I will also set the weight decay to 1e-05, which is adequate for slightly easing potential overfitting, especially considering the client’s limited resources would benefit from a less aggressive regularization. The batch size of 8 is optimal for the client's resource limits, allowing for stable training without excessive memory usage. The dropout rate is kept at 0.2, which was previously beneficial and strikes a balance between regularization and model capacity. The optimizer will remain as SGD with momentum at 0.9 since it has shown reasonable performance in the past. For the server, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.001, which is standard for stable convergence in federated learning, with momentum also at 0.9 and using SGD as the optimizer.

    "reasoning": "Given that the client historically achieved a test accuracy of 79.59% with outdated hyperparameters, there’s room for adjustment. The analysis indicates a need to lower the learning rate, as it aligns with the historical performance and maintains the stability essential for a low-resource client. A learning rate of 0.0003 is the highest permissible value under the constraints while still promoting stability and reducing risks of instability associated with larger values. Additionally, maintaining a lower `weight_decay` of 1e-05 helps regularize performance. The continued use of SGD optimizer suits the client's performance in past trials, and keeping the momentum at 0.9 aligns with effective practices for momentum in SGD. For batch size, I will keep it at 16, as it is acceptable within constraints while still manageable for low-resource clients. I will also retain the dropout rate at 0.2, helping mitigate overfitting without over-complicating the architecture. On the server side, I will use a learning rate of 0.001, which is optimal and is consistent with the previous server settings. The momentum of 0.9 provides good inertia, and the use of SGD optimizer is consistent, ensuring coherence between client and server operations. The same scheduler (‘None’) is used to avoid potential conflicts or adjustments that may not be beneficial to this specific setting.

    "reasoning": "The client's test accuracy was 74.37%, indicating that the model is performing reasonably but there is still room for improvement. The learning rate of 0.001 is at the edge of the higher end of the constraints. In image classification, a lower learning rate can often help with convergence issues if we're close to optimal but not quite there. Hence, I will suggest a lower learning rate of 0.0001, as it might aid fine-tuning and prevent overshooting the minima during training. The weight decay will be set at 0.0005 to provide stronger regularization against overfitting, especially since the training and test accuracies are not drastically different. Keeping momentum at 0.9 aligns with current practices that have shown positive results in the client's history and peer performance. The optimizer choice will remain 'AdamW' as it’s effective and aligns with the previous configuration. I will suggest 'None' for the scheduler as it's been used effectively in the client's previous rounds without introducing unnecessary complexity. The local epochs remain at 2, providing a good balance between computation time and model training. The batch size will be reduced to 32 to accommodate the moderate cluster resource since lower resource clients can sometimes struggle with higher batches. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting risks in the training process, especially given the moderate capacity of the client. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client settings except for the learning rate, which will increase to 0.001 for robustness across clients, and the optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' with a scheduler set to 'None' for the same reasons.",

For `weight_decay`, I will use 0.0001 to provide light regularization while still allowing the model to learn effectively. A `momentum` value of 0.9 is standard and helps accelerate SGD momentum updates, improving convergence. I will choose the `AdamW` optimizer because it is effective for image tasks, especially on datasets like CIFAR-10. The learning strategy will utilize `CosineAnnealingLR`, which helps adjust the learning rate over iterations, making it suitable for optimizing training over several epochs. For `local_epochs`, I will set this to 2 to allow sufficient training time without risking overfitting, and `batch_size` will be set to 64, which is a manageable size given the cluster's capacity. Lastly, I will set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to help mitigate any early overfitting since we will be training on CIFAR-10. In terms of server parameters, to align with the client setup, I will use a similar `learning_rate` of 0.001 and `momentum` of 0.9, along with the `Adam` optimizer and a `None` scheduler as the server does not require a dynamic learning rate adjustment at this stage.

This should allow for a balanced learning pace. For weight decay, I will increase it to 0.0005 to add some regularization while staying below the maximum limit, which can help the model generalize better without compromising performance. The momentum will stay at 0.9, which has historically worked well. I will switch the optimizer to 'SGD' since it can provide better convergence than AdamW in some scenarios, especially in bigger models like ResNet, and a cosine annealing scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR) can additionally enhance learning rates over epochs. I'll maintain the local epochs at 2 to strike a balance without overfitting on the client side. Given that this is a high-resource client, I will opt for a higher batch size of 128 to make better use of the available resources. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate from 0.2 to 0.3 to further mitigate overfitting while ensuring we do not negatively impact the actual learning. On the server-side, the `learning_rate` will remain at 0.001 to maintain consistency given the client's effective use previously, using 'SGD' as well for consistency with the client side.

Therefore, I will suggest a higher `learning_rate` within the allowed range to improve convergence. Since the client is in a low-resource cluster with a smaller `batch_size`, lowering `weight_decay` will help ensure stability during training. I will select `momentum` towards the middle of the allowed range to balance between stagnation and oscillations during optimization. I'm also maintaining the `optimizer` as 'AdamW' for its adaptive learning properties, which should help with the image classification task. The `dropout_rate` will remain low (0.2), as the current test accuracy doesn't strongly suggest overfitting issues. For the server-side, I will stick with a `learning_rate` of 0.001 as it’s an appropriate value for stability and can function well with the rest of the settings. I will use the same optimizer 'AdamW' for consistency and ensure there’s no scheduling changes on the server side.

However, since our constraints limit the client learning rate to a maximum of 0.0005, I will adjust it to this maximum. A higher learning rate might help in this case as the training accuracy could suggest that the model is underfitting based on the historical test performance. Additionally, to prevent issues typical for low-resource clients, I've kept the batch size at 16 as it is the maximum they can handle while still being manageable. The weight decay is kept at 0.0001, which is the same as the previous run, to maintain regularization effects without making it too aggressive. Given the underfitting evidence from the client's history, I am suggesting a higher dropout rate of 0.3, which also aligns with helping mitigate overfitting while still being conservative. The use of 'AdamW' as the optimizer will remain consistent as it aligns with keeping stability under low resources. \n\nFor the server parameters, I will also set the learning rate to 0.0005 to match the maximum allowable value in the context of adjusting for the client’s performance. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' because it effectively stabilizes training in a federated setting.

A `weight_decay` of 0.0005 is chosen to help prevent overfitting while not being excessively strong, which could hinder learning.

The `Adam` optimizer is chosen for its adaptive capabilities, which can perform better on image data by automatically adjusting the learning rate. A `local_epochs` of 2 allows for sufficient updates without over-committing computational resources. A `batch_size` of 64 is fitting for a high-resource client, promoting good gradient estimates without memory overflow. A `dropout_rate` of 0.3 is reasonable to encourage generalization without excessively removing information. For the server’s hyperparameters, I kept the `learning_rate` at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, which are standard for robustness. The `Adam` optimizer is aligned for consistency with the client-side's strategy, and a `None` scheduler is appropriate as we are not dynamically adjusting the learning rate at this stage.

Since overall performance is consistent within the client and peer history (~79% to ~80% test accuracy), we will lower the learning rate to 0.0002 to avoid potential overfitting while remaining effective. The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0005, consistent with prior settings, which aids regularization without penalizing performance too much. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to ensure effective learning dynamics based on previous experiments. The optimizer will be chosen as 'Adam', a solid option for image classification tasks like this. The scheduler remains as 'StepLR' for effectively managing learning rate decay over epochs. We will stick to 2 local epochs and a `batch_size` of 16, both of which are moderate and previously successful. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3 to mitigate the potential for overfitting, given the close accuracy rates in prior attempts. For the server-side parameters, we will match the 'learning_rate' at 0.001 as it is on the higher side of the allowed range, while still being manageable. Using the same momentum of 0.9 seems consistent across both client and peer histories. An optimizer of 'Adam' is also chosen for server-side operations with 'StepLR' for consistent learning rate management.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the client's first round and there's no prior history to analyze, we'll take a conservative approach tailored to the split-fed learning environment and the available high resource capacity. Starting with a moderate learning_rate of 0.001 allows for stable convergence without risking overshooting. Higher learning rates could be tried later if necessary. For weight_decay, I'll set it to 0.0005 to introduce some regularization without being overly restrictive, which is beneficial for preventing potential overfitting. Setting momentum to 0.9 is a standard practice to stabilize training; it balances the previous gradients well. The AdamW optimizer, known for better handling of sparse gradients, is chosen to optimize the ResNet18 model effectively in this scenario. I will also opt for a CosineAnnealingLR scheduler to adjust the learning rate dynamically, promoting gradual improvement over training epochs. With local_epochs set to 2, this should provide sufficient training without overwhelming the computation, and a batch_size of 64 is suitable for high-resource clients, facilitating efficient training. The dropout_rate is set at 0.3 to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn robust features. For the server, a learning_rate of 0.001 with the same momentum of 0.9 and the AdamW optimizer is maintained for coherence in training, and I'll opt for 'None' on the scheduler since server-side optimization is less intricate. Finally, I choose mu at 0.01, a middle-ground value to balance the regularization effect in the federated setting, ensuring that local updates are well aligned with the server's global model.",

The `batch_size` will be 16 as it fits within the low-resource capacity and aligns with the peer's performance. Finally, I will set `dropout_rate` to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting while still allowing enough capacity to learn the underlying data patterns. \n\nFor the server parameters, I'll mirror the client's learning rate and choose 'AdamW' as the optimizer, as it worked well for a peer.

    "reasoning": "The client has used a learning rate of 0.0005 previously, with reasonably strong test accuracy of 68.48%. Given that the constraints allow a lower learning rate, reducing it to 0.0003 might help with stability on low-resource clients while ensuring it's still above the minimum threshold. The weight decay is currently at 0.0001, which does not fit within the required range; thus, increasing it to 0.0002 will provide slightly better regularization without causing overfitting. The momentum remains optimal at 0.9, as suggested by prior configurations. The optimizer 'AdamW' has proven effective and remains the best choice. For the local_epochs, retaining a value of 2 is sensible, given stability needs. The batch size of 16 has already been established as a working configuration, maintaining the potential for stable training. Finally, for the dropout_rate, increasing it slightly to 0.4 may help with overfitting given that both train and test accuracies have been generally strong. For the server-side, keeping the learning rate at 0.001 ensures that the global model can still effectively combine weights from all clients. The momentum of 0.9 follows the current logic, and using the same optimizer 'AdamW' ensures consistency across client-server setups, while 'None' for the scheduler appears to simplify the setup appropriately.

An initial learning rate of 0.001 is appropriate as it is within the specified constraints and is a commonly used starting point for image classification tasks. To allow the model to extract useful features while preventing overfitting, a weight decay of 0.0001 will help regularize the model without being overly restrictive. I've selected the Adam optimizer due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which is beneficial for the unique variations in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The local_epochs are set to 3 to maintain enough iterations for good model convergence, and a batch size of 32 balances training efficiency with resource considerations appropriate for a medium-resource client. Regarding the dropout rate, I'll set it to 0.1 for a slight regularization effect. For the server parameters, I mirrored the client’s learning rate and momentum selections (0.001 and 0.9) for consistency, using the Adam optimizer for the same reasons.

This is aligned with the need for a lower learning rate if underfitting occurs; however, based on peer history, this learning rate should yield stable improvements. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0001 to combat potential overfitting, especially since it has been low in previous attempts, allowing for slightly more regularization without causing underfitting.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client, we have no prior performance metrics to rely on. However, considering that this is a powerful client (Cluster 2), we can afford to use a more aggressive learning rate and larger batch size. A `learning_rate` of 0.001 strikes a balance between conservativeness and aggression, allowing faster learning without risking divergence. A `weight_decay` of 1e-04 will help with regularization and combat potential overfitting, as image models can often suffer from this. For `momentum`, a value of 0.9 is a standard choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging. The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen because it generally performs well with image data and adapts the learning rate for each parameter dynamically, which is beneficial for the complexities often seen in image classification tasks. A `batch_size` of 64 leverages the client's high-capacity resources without overwhelming them. I will use a `dropout_rate` of 0.3, providing a balance to help prevent overfitting while still allowing for sufficient model capacity. As this is the first round and no scheduling need has been indicated, I suggest using 'None' for the scheduler. On the server side, I will keep the `learning_rate` at 0.001, using the same optimizer and momentum to maintain consistency, and also set the scheduler to 'None' for the same reason.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round, we don't have historical data points to guide us, but we must adhere to the algorithm's requirements and best practices for image classification tasks. The guidance suggests that the learning rate and optimizer choice are critical. In medium-resource environments, we should aim for reasonable defaults to prevent underfitting and overfitting. I will choose a moderately low learning rate of 0.001 to mitigate potential overfitting while giving the model thorough training. For the optimizer, AdamW offers better performance with image data compared to SGD, particularly for its ability to adaptively adjust learning rates. A weight decay of 0.0001 will be implemented for light regularization, while a momentum of 0.9 will help accelerate gradients across the optimization landscape. A batch size of 32 is a balanced option for medium-resource clients, allowing efficient data processing without overloading their capacity. For dropout, I will set it to 0.2 to help prevent overfitting without being too aggressive. Local epochs will be set to 2 as a compromise between achieving a robust model and not overburdening resources without historical context. For the server, I will align the learning rate and optimizer with the client's settings to maintain consistency. A moderate `mu` of 0.05 is chosen for normal federated optimization control as it falls comfortably within the permissible range.

A moderate dropout rate of 0.3 is suggested to improve generalization. For `momentum`, I will keep it at 0.9 as it remained constant and compliant with the peer's performance. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' due to its effectiveness in dealing with image classification tasks, and the `local_epochs` will be set at 2, aligning with successful previous settings. The batch size will be maximized at 128 given the high resource capabilities of the client.

The analysis of peer history indicates that the optimal learning rate was 0.0005, which allowed Client 289 to achieve a notable accuracy of 51.64%. Hence, I’ll set the client's learning_rate to 0.0005, which is within the required range and should be stable for training on weak clients. For weight_decay, I'll opt for a low value of 1e-06 to begin with, as this aligns with the peer's successful strategy and doesn't impose significant restrictions on model flexibility. The momentum is set to 0.9 to ensure a good balance between stability and exploratory learning. AdamW is chosen as it is more adaptive compared to SGD and works well with image classification tasks. I am also setting the local_epochs to 2, which is a common choice that balances training time and effectiveness. The batch_size will be 8 as this is the smallest option, catering to the client's low-resource nature, and it allows for more granular updates. A dropout_rate of 0.2 is used to tackle potential overfitting without hampering learning too significantly. For the server, I will mirror the learning rate and optimizer from the peer to maintain a consistent training approach and add resilience to local updates. I will also keep the momentum at 0.9.

The client's learning_rate was already at the maximum threshold (0.0005) within the constraint range and had a weight_decay of 1e-06. The reported accuracy suggests there may be some issues with overfitting since the learning rate is higher. Therefore, I'll adjust the weight_decay to 1e-05 which is at the upper limit to add more regularization. This should help combat any overfitting while the learning_rate remains stable at 0.0005. The batch_size of 8 is suitable considering the low-resource client capacity, ensuring stable training. I also suggest maintaining the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has worked well previously. For dropout_rate, I will increase it to 0.3, which is within the limits, to further mitigate overfitting. The local_epochs will remain at 2 for balanced updates without overwhelming the low-resource client at this stage. For the server hyperparameters, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is conservative yet effective for server-side updates.

The peer, Client 379, achieved respectable accuracy with a learning rate of 0.001, so I will start there as well to maintain consistency and potentially improve performance. A weight decay of 0.0001 is commonly effective for regularization without being too heavy-handed, allowing the model to learn effectively without overfitting at the start. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is often optimal for stabilizing the SGD updates. I will choose the SGD optimizer, as it is widely used with ConvNets like ResNet and aligns with the guidance of using SGD for image classification tasks. For the batch size, I will select 128 (the largest option available), which the high-resource client can handle, allowing for efficient gradient computation. I've also added a dropout rate of 0.2, following the established trend of using dropout to mitigate potential overfitting in image classification tasks. I will set the local epochs to 2 to allow enough training per round without causing substantial overfitting right away. For the server, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum from the client side to promote consistency within the federated learning framework since the server updates influence the overall training dynamics.

Given that the peer's model with the same hyperparameters achieved a slightly higher accuracy (82.47%), a few adjustments are warranted to explore better performance. Since both the client's and peer's configurations used the same learning rate (0.001) and weight decay (0.0001), it may be advantageous to slightly increase the learning rate within the bounds provided while still ensuring stability and minimizing the risk of overfitting. Therefore, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005 for the client side, which is the upper limit, to see if this can lead to improved convergence. Additionally, maintaining `weight_decay` to 0.0001 retains a good level of regularization without incurring overfitting risks. The dropout rate will be kept at 0.2, which has previously shown to work well. For the server, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 as it has been effective in previous rounds. The choice of SG as the optimizer remains, as the momentum lies comfortably within the specified range. The value of `mu` is also kept at 0.01, as this has been effective for the federated scheme.

The weight decay of 0.0005 used by Client 223 also aligns with best practices for regularization to mitigate overfitting, making it a prudent choice. The momentum of 0.9 is standard for many models, aiding in faster convergence, so I will adopt that value as well. The optimizer 'AdamW' is effective for such tasks, providing a good balance of adaptive learning with weight decay. A dropout rate of 0.4 has been beneficial in peer performance; however, since this is the first round, I will suggest a slightly lower dropout rate of 0.3, which still provides regularization while allowing for learning. Batch size should be adequate to exploit the high-resource capability of the client, thus a size of 128 is both powerful and permissible.

The learning rate of 0.00025 may not be aggressive enough to allow the model to learn effectively, as highlighted by the test accuracies around 78.56% and peer performance of 77.60%. Therefore, I suggest increasing the learning rate to 0.00015, which is still within the constraints. The weight decay of 0.00075 is valid but could be increased slightly to 0.0008 to improve regularization without overfitting, given that the client's highest accuracy (80.27%) suggests that we might need tighter constraints on the weights to improve generalization. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it stabilizes training effectively. The optimizer is still 'AdamW,' which has shown promise for this task. The scheduler will remain as 'StepLR' because it has helped previously but will limit changes that can lead to instability. I am maintaining a local_epochs value of 2 as this has been consistent, and it aligns with the previous setups without overwhelming the medium-resource capability of the client. For the batch_size, I'll set it to 16, as this balances well for the resource constraints. Lastly, I'll keep the dropout_rate at 0.4, which is on the higher end and should help with regularization given the performance dynamics observed. The server parameters will be derived similarly, with a learning rate of 0.001 based on prior efficacy, momentum retained at 0.9, and 'AdamW' used for consistency, while keeping 'StepLR' for the scheduler. The mu value remains at 0.01 because it has been stable in prior settings.

Since both accuracy measures were not drastically far apart, this suggests the model might be slightly underfitting or is not optimized as efficiently as peer models. Therefore, a small increase in the `learning_rate` is appropriate, given the high-resource capability of the client. I will set the `learning_rate` to 0.0005, the upper limit of the allowed range. The previous weight_decay was 0.0005; maintaining it will ensure that we do not induce overfitting while enabling slightly aggressive learning. It’s worth noting that peer dropout_rate was higher (0.4) and yielded better results, indicating potential for improvement. Therefore, I will increase the `dropout_rate` to 0.4. The parameter for `local_epochs` can remain at 2, per precedent. As for the remaining parameters, I’ll keep `optimizer` as 'AdamW' and `scheduler` as 'None' for consistency with past configurations that provide decent performance.

Thus, I propose a `weight_decay` of 0.0005. The `batch_size` can be increased to 128, which is manageable for the high-resource client but must remain as per the available options.

To adhere to the strict constraints for low-resource clients, the learning rate must be lowered to stay within the required range. I will set the learning rate to 0.0002, which is a reasonable adjustment downward and still allows for effective learning without risking instability. Previously, the test accuracy was higher when a smaller learning rate (0.0003) was used, indicating this adjustment is still on the right track. \n\nThe weight decay will remain at 0.0005 to avoid overfitting while adhering to the allowed range. The momentum will also stay at 0.9 based on the previous configuration, which has proven effective.\n\nThe optimizer will remain as 'AdamW,' which is showing strong results in the history, and the 'None' scheduler is adequate given the consistency in performance without additional scheduling complexity. \n\nFor 'local_epochs', I will set it at 2 to maintain a balance between training time and performance improvement. The batch size will remain at 16 as it has been stable in the previous runs. The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.4, as it is already helping with regularization based on prior settings. \n\nFor the server parameters, I will set the learning rate to 0.0002, slightly lower than the previous setting to promote convergence while adhering to the constraint range. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 and retain 'AdamW' as the optimizer to ensure consistency. The scheduler will again be 'None' to avoid complications, as it has shown reliability in past configurations. \n\nFinally, to align with the federated scheme and the client's low-resource context, I have assigned mu to 0.01.

I will choose a learning rate of 0.001, which is within the mid-range, offering a balance between fast learning and stability. For the weight_decay, a value of 0.0001 is low but will help slightly counteract overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively in its initial training phase. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a common choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, improving convergence speed. My optimizer choice is 'AdamW', known for its efficient performance on tasks like image classification. The scheduler will be 'CosineAnnealingLR', which helps in cyclic learning rates, aiding convergence during training. Given the high-resource capacity of the client, a local_epochs value of 3 will be chosen for thorough training. The batch_size of 64 is substantial and aligns with client capabilities. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is selected to help regularize the model without being too aggressive, striking a balance for this initial training run. For the server side, I will mirror the client's optimizer and momentum settings to maintain consistency in the federated learning setup.

As the task is image classification using ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, key hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer choice are crucial. For powerful clients like Cluster 2, I can afford to use a higher learning rate within the allowed range to encourage faster convergence. I chose a learning rate of 0.001, balancing speed and stability. I opted for 'AdamW' as the optimizer due to its well-documented performance in vision tasks, particularly with deeper networks like ResNet. The weight decay is set at 1e-04 for regularization, as it helps mitigate potential overfitting without overly restricting the learning process. The momentum is set to 0.9, a conventional choice that supports faster convergence. The local epochs are limited to 2, allowing for an adequate number of updates while preventing excessive training time. I went for a batch size of 64, which is a standard choice that should work well with the powerful resources of this client. A dropout rate of 0.2 is introduced to help combat potential overfitting without hindering learning. For server parameters, I kept them aligned with client settings to ensure consistent training dynamics; hence I used the same optimizer and learning rate.

The client operates in a low-resource cluster, indicating the need for smaller batch sizes and cautious learning rates. I will set the learning rate at 0.0002, as peers have successfully used this rate, which is below the midpoint of the permissible range and seemingly stable for training. The weight decay is set to 0.0001 to promote regularization, especially since the early diagnostics will likely indicate minimal tension between training and test accuracy at this stage. For momentum, I'll use 0.9, which aligns with successful implementations among peers, so prioritizing tried-and-true methods makes sense. 'Adam' is chosen as the optimizer for its adaptive capabilities, particularly useful in a potentially unstable client environment. The batch size is set to 16 to accommodate the client's low-resource capacity while still being effective. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.3 is in the middle of the range which should help with overfitting without overly sacrificing model capacity.

The scheduler is set to 'None' to keep initial stages straightforward. For the local epochs, we choose 2 to balance the local learning cycle without overburdening the client. The batch size of 32 aligns well with peer usage and client capacity, and a dropout rate of 0.4 helps mitigate overfitting while not being excessively high.

    "reasoning": "Given the client's history of achieving a test accuracy of 77.70% with hyperparameters including a learning rate of 0.001, I will maintain a similar learning rate since it's already performing reasonably well. However, to mitigate potential overfitting, I will increase the weight_decay from 0.0001 to 0.0005, which is still within the allowed range and can help improve test accuracy. The momentum will be held at 0.9, as this is a commonly effective value. For the optimizer, I will continue with 'Adam' since the client has previously used it successfully. The scheduler will remain as 'CosineAnnealingLR' for smooth learning rate adjustments in the training process. Keeping local_epochs at 3 is optimal due to the client’s high-resource capacity, which allows for maximized learning per data segment. The batch_size will remain at 128, which is manageable and provides sufficient training batches. Lastly, I will increase the dropout_rate to 0.3, helping to further combat any overfitting by randomly dropping out units during training, leading to a more robust model. For the server-side parameters, I will match the learning rate and momentum with the client's settings unless improvements are indicated, keeping simplicity in coordination. So, a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 in the server will be consistent. The optimizer for the server will also be 'Adam'.

Lastly, I will suggest a dropout_rate of 0.3, which will help mitigate potential overfitting risk as ResNet architectures can be prone to overfitting on smaller datasets such as CIFAR-10. For the server, the parameters mirror the client's learning settings, aiding stability in the federated setting.

    "reasoning": "The current learning rate of 0.01 is likely too high, given the client's test accuracy (78.69%) is lower than expected (which usually suggests overfitting). A more conservative learning rate of 0.005 will help with exploration while reducing the risk of overfitting. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0001 will add regularization to combat overfitting, as high training accuracy but lower testing accuracy indicates that the model is learning noise. The momentum remains at 0.9, which is a common practice in optimizing, and I will use 'AdamW' as the optimizer because it has shown effectiveness in training deep learning models. I will retain the local epochs at 2, as this is currently yielding reasonable results without over-training. For batch size, I will opt for 128 since it's within the allowed values and the client is high-resource, meaning they can handle it without sacrificing performance. Keeping the dropout rate at 0.3 is reasonable as it should already provide some regularization. On the server side, I will mirror the optimizer and momentum choices from the client side to maintain consistency in updates.

For this iteration, I will suggest a slightly **lower learning rate of 0.002**, which is still within the allowed range, to ensure careful convergence and avoid overshooting during training. The **weight decay will increase to 0.0005** as this would add more regularization to combat any potential overfitting issues, while still adhering to the given constraints. The **momentum** will remain at **0.9** as it has proven effective in the past. The optimizer will stay as **AdamW**, which has shown good performance. I will keep the **local_epochs at 2** to balance training time and performance, and increase the **batch_size to 64** since the client has high resources, which allows for larger batch sizes.

To avoid overfitting while maintaining a decent learning rate, I will recommend keeping the learning rate at 0.001. Regarding weight decay, to combat overfitting, I will increase it from 0.0001 to 0.0005 to add more regularization. The selected optimizer is 'Adam' due to the client's previous success with it. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 and maintain the local_epochs at 3 as it helps the model learn effectively with their cluster's high resources. A batch size of 128 is selected, which aligns with the resources and provides a good trade-off between performance and trainability.

    "reasoning": "Given the client's previous test accuracy of 81.74%, we have good evidence that the model is performing well. However, to further enhance generalization and prevent potential overfitting, I suggest slightly decreasing the learning rate. Choosing a learning rate of 0.0005 ensures the training process remains stable while allowing for a more granular convergence. The previous weight decay of 0.0001 is sufficient, but I will slightly raise it to 0.0002 to promote better regularization. A momentum of 0.9 is standard and has worked well in the past, so I will retain that. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW', as it is known to be effective for image classification tasks. The scheduler will continue to be 'CosineAnnealingLR' for its capability of adjusting the learning rate dynamically during training. For local epochs, I will keep it at 2, which is effective given the computational capacity. A batch size of 128 aligns with the high resource availability of the client. Finally, I'll increase the dropout to 0.3 to mitigate potential overfitting more aggressively. On the server side, I will set the learning rate at 0.001 as it is optimal for an effective training process, supported by the previous experience. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 and the optimizer as 'AdamW', maintaining consistency. The scheduler will be set to 'None' for simplicity and functionality at the server level. Lastly, I will set `mu` to 0.05 to balance the influence of federated regularization.

The weight decay will be set to 0.0006, to help regularize any potential overfitting caused by increasing learning rate, in line with the guidance that suggests using a higher weight decay when training accuracy is much higher than test accuracy. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW', given its previous successes and is known for handling overfitting better than SGD in image classification tasks. The batch size is chosen as 128 instead of 64, allowing the high-resource client to leverage its computational power for faster training. The dropout rate is increased to 0.35, to better balance between the model's ultimate flexibility and regularization features to combat both underfitting and overfitting. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 to maintain stability in server-side learning, while 'AdamW' as optimizer remains, as seen in previous favorable results. The mu value will be set to 0.01 for controlling the federated learning dynamics, a value used consistently so far and has yielded positive results.",

Therefore, I will set the learning_rate to 0.0005 to start, which is conservative enough to prevent oscillations. The weight_decay parameter is also important for regularization; a weight_decay value of 0.0005 aligns with what has worked for peer client 109 and avoids overfitting.

Suggested local_epochs is 2 based on peer practices, allowing for thorough training without becoming too time-consuming.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the client's first round and there is no previous history to analyze, I will make conservative choices based on the research-backed guidance provided. The task is image classification using ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Considering the potential for underfitting given that there are no prior results to lean on, it is prudent to select a slightly higher `learning_rate`. Therefore, I have set the `learning_rate` to 0.005. This value is well within the allowed range and should provide a good balance between learning speed and stability. \n\nFor the `weight_decay`, I will choose a moderate value of 0.0005. This choice is justified because it helps regularize the model, especially in image classification tasks where overfitting is common, yet I want to ensure that it does not hinder convergence. \n\nThe `momentum` is set to 0.9, which is a standard practice and often provides better convergence, as well as helping to smooth the optimization paths. \n\nGiven the moderate resource capacity of the client, I will recommend a `batch_size` of 32. This is a balanced choice; it’s large enough to benefit from batch normalization while remaining feasible given the client's capacity. I will also set `local_epochs` to 2 to ensure sufficient training without overburdening the client resources. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.3 based on the recommendation to limit overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. \n\nOn the server side, I am also recommending a `learning_rate` of 0.005, similar to the client, to encourage cohesive training dynamics across clients. The momentum and optimizer choices mirror those made for the client. I will use the `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler, as it is generally effective in managing the learning rate dynamically during training, which can be particularly beneficial in a federated learning setting. Finally, I have set `mu` to 0.01, adhering to the constraint and providing a reasonable trade-off in terms of regularization in the FedProx scheme.",

I'll set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is a standard choice for starting training as it is neither too aggressive nor too passive, thus helping to prevent both underfitting and overfitting in this initial round. For weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0001 to introduce a small amount of regularization to help mitigate overfitting without being too harsh. The momentum will be set to 0.9 as it is a typical value that can help speed up convergence in the optimization process. I will choose the Adam optimizer since it generally performs well for image classification tasks. The scheduler will be set to 'StepLR', which allows for scheduled learning rate decay, aiding in fine-tuning as training progresses. For local_epochs, setting it to 2 would provide a balance between training time and allowing the client to learn effectively on their dataset. A batch_size of 64 is both manageable for a medium-resource client and typically effective in image classification. Lastly, I will set the dropout_rate to 0.3 to help regularize the model without overly disrupting the learning process.

I have noted that their learning rate of 0.0005 provides a balance between training speed and stability, so I will choose a similar value.

A learning rate of 0.0003 is proven to yield results for other peers without overstepping typical issues related to instability. For weight decay, retaining 0.0005 would be appropriate as it's within the allowed range and offers some regularization without being too aggressive. The momentum is kept at 0.9, common for AdamW, which should retain effective training stability. The optimizer choice remains 'AdamW' as this has been effective for image classification on CIFAR-10.

To address potential overfitting (as the accuracy is high but we have a small range of hyperparameters), I'll set the learning rate to the maximum allowed of 0.0002 while also increasing weight_decay to the maximum of 0.0002 for better regularization. This should help reduce overfitting. The dropout rate has helped improve generalization (increased from 0.3 to 0.4 previously), so I will keep it at 0.4 to support continued improvements. The momentum will stay at 0.9 as it has been consistent in previous configurations with no negative impact.

I will adopt a learning_rate of 0.0003 as it balances well between the extremes and is likely not to lead to instability. The weight_decay of 0.0001 will help prevent overfitting without significantly affecting learning. A momentum of 0.9 is reasonable as it is commonly effective in optimizers like AdamW. The optimizer will be set to AdamW since it is shown to perform well in image classification tasks. The local_epochs will be set to 3, providing sufficient training on local data without overwhelming computational resources. A batch_size of 16 ensures that the model is trained efficiently without exceeding the client's medium-resource capacity. A dropout_rate of 0.4 is aimed at mitigating overfitting, given that it's a common issue in image classification and is consistent with the peer’s choice. For server parameters, I will mirror the learning_rate and momentum from the client, and I will also use the AdamW optimizer since it works well generally in federated learning scenarios.

A learning rate of 0.0002 is optimal as it's less than the previous rate and aligns with the adaptation strategy.

I suggest maintaining the batch size at 128 as it fits high-resource capabilities, but adjusting it to 96 can also help provide a more granular approach to updates. Given the potential overfitting, I suggest increasing the dropout rate to 0.3 to enhance regularization. On the server side, I will mirror the client learning rate of 0.003, as consistency might encourage effective weight sharing. The momentum and optimizer would also remain consistent. The mu parameter needs to be set thoughtfully to ensure the FedProx regularization has sufficient strength, so I suggest using a mid-range value of 0.05 for stability during training.",

The test accuracy is lower than optimal, suggesting potential overfitting; a lower learning rate can stabilize training. \n2. **Weight Decay**: I will increase the weight decay from 0.0001 to 0.0005 to enhance regularization. This aligns with the guidance indicating that a higher weight decay may help combat overfitting when training accuracy exceeds test accuracy.\n3. **Batch Size**: I will keep the batch size at 64 because it's already at the maximum for the client’s capacity, and there are no constraints to reduce it further (the allowed sizes are 32 or 16).  \n4. **Dropout Rate**: I will increase the dropout rate from 0.1 to 0.2. Since dropout helps to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0, this should assist in improving the model's generalizability. \n5. **Server Learning Rate and Optimizer**: The server parameters remain unchanged (learning rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, optimizer as AdamW, scheduler as None), as these values align well with expected needs and the current state of the training.\n6. **mu Parameter**: I will maintain mu at 0.01, which provides a sensible balance between local training and the central model's effect, ensuring effective federated learning under the FedProx scheme.",

Momentum is suggested at 0.9, which is consistent with the client's prior setup and within the allowed range. I've chosen the 'AdamW' optimizer due to its advantages in adapting learning rates. The batch size is minimized to 8 from 16 to better match the low resources of the client. The local epochs are constrained to 2, balancing training time against resource usage. The dropout rate is increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting while allowing the model to learn from the available data.

The most recent configuration achieved a test accuracy of 75.76% which indicates improvement, however, the client is in a low-resource scenario which necessitates values for hyperparameters that facilitate more stable training. Given that learning rates are currently set at 0.0005, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0003, approaching the client's lower capacity ability to train while still being effective. The weight decay will also be increased to 0.0003, which is the maximum allowed, to combat any risk of overfitting as we tighten the learning rate. The momentum is retained at 0.9, as this value has shown stability in the past. For the optimizer, AdamW remains in place, given its adaptability in handling different capacities. The dropout rate will be increased slightly to 0.4, to further aid generalization and combat potential overfitting risks identified in training versus testing accuracies. The batch size will remain at 16 due to its historical performance and because it fits within the allowed parameters for the low-resource setup. Local epochs will also be set to 2 to ensure enough training time without over-committing resources. For the server, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.0005 since the server's performance is not limited in the same way, and consistency is beneficial during federated learning where different client improvements can be integrated.

However, looking at the peer's history of Client 245, who utilized a learning rate of 0.0002, a weight decay of 0.0005, and achieved a test accuracy of 76.11%, I will use this as a reference point. Given the medium-resource capacity of our client, a moderate `learning_rate` and `batch_size` will be employed. The `learning_rate` is set at 0.0002 to avoid aggressive updates. A moderate `weight_decay` of 0.0005 will help in regularization without excessively penalizing the weights, addressing any potential overfitting concerns due to the relatively complex nature of the ResNet18 model. The `momentum` will be set to 0.9 to accelerate gradients and effectively navigate through adverse local minima. I will select `AdamW` as the optimizer because it balances the benefits of adaptive learning rates with weight decay regularization. The `scheduler` uses `CosineAnnealingLR` to adapt the learning rate over epochs, ensuring smooth convergence. For `local_epochs`, I chose 2 to provide the model with sufficient iterations to learn from the local dataset without risking overfitting. A `batch_size` of 16 is optimal for medium-resource clients, ensuring more stable updates and manageable resource utilization, while a `dropout_rate` of 0.3 introduces regularization to combat overfitting in deeper architectures.

Peer 290 achieved a high accuracy of 79.95% with a learning rate of 0.0005, which is on the conservative side and aligns well with the expectations of clients with medium capacity. Considering client 387 is also in the medium resource category, I will adopt a similar learning rate. The weight decay from peer 290 (0.0001) is minimal, which seems appropriate for an initial run, thus I will retain it. Regarding momentum, I'll set it to 0.9, a value which is common across peer histories. The optimizer ‘AdamW’ is chosen since it has shown effectiveness in peer experiments. For local_epochs, I will set it to 2, as it helps balance between training time and model convergence, being a value frequently observed in peer history. The batch size will be set to 32, the median choice available, which is reasonable for medium-resource clients. A dropout rate of 0.3 is reasonable to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively; it is also aligned with the dropout chosen by Peer 290. As for the server-side configurations, I will follow the settings used successfully by Peer 290, maintaining the same learning rate and optimizer, but specify no scheduler for simplicity, favoring less complexity in this initial round. The mu value will be set to 0.01, a value which matches the peers and is safely within the allowable range, providing mild regularization while ensuring effective model training.",

Based on peer performance, increasing the dropout rate may help with overfitting, while maintaining a moderate learning rate is critical due to split-federated learning constraints. I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0003 because it is the maximum allowed value within the constraints, and previous settings of 0.0005 did not yield optimal results. A weight decay of 0.0001 will remain to prevent overfitting while providing some regularization. I will keep the momentum at 0.9, as this is effective based on peer trends. The optimizer will be retained as 'AdamW' to maintain consistency with effective practices from peers, and 'CosineAnnealingLR' will remain to schedule the learning rate effectively. The local epochs will be retained at 2, and I will increase the batch size to 64 to exploit the medium-resource capacity better and to potentially boost convergence speed. A dropout rate of 0.4 is selected, inspired by the peer with a 79.95% accuracy, which may indicate that a higher dropout helps prevent overfitting. For the server parameters, I will set the server learning rate to 0.001, keeping consistency with previous effective configurations; I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 and retain 'AdamW' as the optimizer for synchronization across clients and server.

A weight_decay of 0.0005 is reasonable for preventing overfitting given the cluster's capacity and is within the allowed limits. The momentum will be set to 0.9, which is a commonly used value and helps in accelerating gradients in the right directions. We’ll choose the Adam optimizer for its efficiency and effectiveness in training deep neural networks, particularly in image classification tasks. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for a more nuanced adjustment of the learning rate as training progresses. We will opt for a local_epochs count of 2, which balances between fast iterations and adequate training. The batch_size will be set to 64, taking advantage of the client’s high-resource capability. A dropout_rate of 0.3 is selected as a middle ground to promote generalization without being too aggressive given no previous training results have indicated overfitting. On the server side, we'll mirror the learning rate and momentum settings as they maintain consistency across client-server training dynamics, implementing 'None' as the scheduler since this is the initial round and might not require sophisticated learning adjustments.

Given that the test accuracy is high, we must be cautious about overfitting while adjusting learning_rate and weight_decay. The client's last learning rate was set at 0.001, but looking at the overall task guidance, a decrease in this value might help refine model generalization, so I recommend reducing it to 0.0005. I will also increase weight_decay to 0.001 to further enhance regularization, given the potential for overfitting with such a high accuracy. The momentum can remain at 0.9, as it aligns well within the advised limits. As for the optimizer, I will continue using 'SGD', as it is often effective for image classification tasks like this and was previously successful. The local_epochs will stay at 2, as this strikes a balance between learning and resource use for medium-capacity clients. I will also shift the batch_size to 64, providing a good compromise between processing efficiency and training stability, which will help the model learn better with less overfitting risk due to the larger mini-batch size. The dropout_rate can safely be increased to 0.3 from 0.2 to enhance generalization further. For the server parameters, I will match the client's choices wherever applicable. This leads to the server's learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 with the 'SGD' optimizer, as these provide a solid baseline for synchronization.

Since the task is an image classification with potential risks of overfitting (high training accuracy vs. moderate test accuracy), I will suggest a slightly different set of hyperparameters. Keeping the learning rate low (0.0005) will help further in preventing overfitting while still allowing for robust training, as this value is still effective in the range that had been successful previously. For weight_decay, I will increase it slightly to 0.0005 to fight overfitting further. The momentum remains at 0.9, which has been effective, and I will retain the 'AdamW' optimizer as opposed to switching to SGD which may reduce performance. The dropout_rate will increase to 0.3 to add more regularization during training. Following the client's capacity of a medium-resource cluster, I will keep local_epochs at 2 (which is optimal between 1 and 3), and I will opt for a batch_size of 32 as it has been effective with previous configurations. For the server, I will use the same learning rate (0.001), momentum (0.9), and the 'AdamW' optimizer to ensure consistency in training and model convergence. The scheduler will stay as 'None' for simplicity, as complex scheduling isn't necessary at this point.

Given the overall context and the medium-resource capabilities of the client, I recommend a slightly reduced learning rate of 0.0005 to refine the learning process without risking instability. The current weight decay of 0.0001 is sufficient for regularization but could be increased to 0.0005 to help prevent potential overfitting further if necessary. The momentum is set at 0.9, which is optimal for stabilizing the training. I recommend switching from 'Adam' to 'AdamW' as the optimizer to incorporate weight decay directly into the optimization process, which could lead to better results with ResNet. The batch size of 32 is slightly larger than allowed; therefore, I suggest dropping to the nearest valid size of 24, which aligns with the client's medium-resource classification. The dropout rate of 0.3 suggests a balanced approach to regularization, but increasing it slightly up to 0.4 might help reduce overfitting if necessary, especially with the increased batch size. On the server side, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 works well, and keeping the same momentum and optimizer (Adam) is consistent across both sides. The mu value of 0.01 is appropriate for FedProx regularization, helping to balance between local and global updates effectively.",

The 'optimizer' will also be set to 'SGD', which is currently preferred in peer success cases. The 'scheduler' will be set to 'None' as the peer strategy did not include it, and this will maintain simplicity. For 'local_epochs', I will use 2, an intermediate value that allows enough gradients to stabilize without overwhelming the low-resource capability of the client. The 'batch_size' will be set to 16 to keep the computations manageable, a value chosen by peer 276. Lastly, I recommend a 'dropout_rate' of 0.2 to mitigate potential overfitting while still maintaining enough representational capacity.

This is a good baseline, indicating that we should maintain a similar learning rate to avoid drastic changes, which might harm performance. Given client 205's slightly lower accuracy with a learning rate of 0.0001, it's clear that going lower might risk underfitting. I will then set the learning rate to the maximum allowable within the constraints, which is 0.0001, as it may support further convergence while ensuring more consistent updates. I will also set weight_decay to 0.0001, as it was effective in past trials to mitigate overfitting risks, especially given that the accuracy was quite high relative to the potential for overfitting. The momentum will remain at the standard 0.9, which has been consistently used successfully by the client and peers. The optimizer will stay as SGD, which is currently used, and no changes to the scheduler is needed since 'StepLR' is appropriate for this scenario. Local epochs will remain at 2 based on prior usage, and the batch size at 32 is consistent with medium-resource clients while also fitting the previous context. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.4 is suitable as it effectively helps balance overfitting without reducing the model’s capacity excessively. For the server-side, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, as this has proven effective. The optimizer remains as SGD providing stability in updates across clients.

The `weight_decay` has also varied, but a slightly higher value (0.0003) could help mitigate overfitting observed in the recent epochs. The choice of `momentum` remains at 0.9, as it has proven effective in the past. The optimizer `AdamW` has been stable; thus, it will remain. Since previous configurations did not fully utilize the batch size options, upping the `batch_size` to 32 makes sense for more accelerated convergence with available resources.

Therefore, retaining a `learning_rate` of 0.0005 is appropriate, as it is within the recommended range and previously yielded competitive results. Given the client's performance and the peer history mentions, especially Client 386 who had success with a `weight_decay` of 1e-05, I suggest decreasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0001 to slightly enhance regularization without pushing our constraints. The momentum remains at 0.9, consistent with successful configurations. The optimizer will switch to 'Adam' for better adaptability in low-resource environments based on its general effectiveness, as indicated by the peer history. I further suggest lowering `local_epochs` to 2 due to the low-resource capacity of the client. For `dropout_rate`, I will increase this to 0.4, given the performance improvements seen with approaches that incorporate dropout in similar configurations. For the server configuration, I'll maintain a `learning_rate` of 0.001 and an optimizer of 'Adam' for consistency with prior effective server configurations, ensuring that the `momentum` remains at 0.9. Finally, I will set `mu` to 0.01 to balance the FedProx regularization, based on prior successful setups and guidance.",

As the test accuracy only slightly improved from Epoch 28 to Epoch 32 while using lower learning rates, this indicates potential underfitting. To combat this, I recommend increasing the learning rate slightly closer to the upper constraint to potentially improve performance. The recent experimentation showed that a learning rate of 0.0003 previously yielded a test accuracy of 78.39%, so I will set it to a slightly higher value within constraints. The weight decay is set higher than the previous value to try to prevent overfitting given the relatively stable train/test accuracies. The client has been using a dropout rate of 0.3 which is moderate; maintaining it allows for some regularization without being too aggressive. The batch size of 16 is more manageable for the client's moderate resources and could help in faster convergence. For the server hyperparameters, the learning rate is kept constant as previously utilized, and the optimizer remains 'AdamW' to match the client’s setting for compatibility, and 'None' for scheduler maintains stability without introducing additional complexity.

The learning rate and weight decay are chosen based on the constraints provided to ensure the model doesn't converge too fast due to resource limitations. For the local_epochs, I will choose 2 based on peer history's successful use to allow sufficient training without overwhelming the client resources. Regarding batch_size, I will set it to 16, the same as the peer, to strike a balance between computational load and gradient approximation. A dropout_rate of 0.4 is reasonable and aligns with peer data that showed success in controlling overfitting.

Hence, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0002, as this is still within the constraint but more conservative and can potentially stabilize training. The weight decay of 0.0007 is already low, thus keeping it unchanged helps regularize without imposing too much restriction on learning. The momentum of 0.9 is retained as it's a common choice and should work well with the AdamW optimizer, which I will also keep because it's generally effective for image classification tasks. The batch size remains at 16 since we are constrained to low-resource clients and this size was effective in their previous configurations. The dropout rate will also remain at 0.4 since it suggests that overfitting is managed well at this level.

The learning rate of 0.0005 is currently near the middle of the allowed range, and previous iterations with lower values have resulted in slightly less accuracy. Therefore, I will suggest a higher learning rate of 0.0005, which is still acceptable according to the constraints. Since the previous test accuracy was quite close to 80% but has fluctuated, indicating possible minor overfitting issues, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 for better regularization.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round, we have no historical data to guide hyperparameter tuning, but we can draw insights from current best practices for image classification with ResNet18. To strike a balance between learning stability and convergence speed, I've selected a moderate learning_rate of 0.001. This is within the provided constraints and is a common starting point for training deep networks, especially on datasets like CIFAR10. A weight_decay of 0.0005 is chosen to help mitigate any potential overfitting, as this dataset can lead to complex models that easily memorize training examples. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is a common choice to accelerate convergence and is known to work well for SGD optimizers. AdamW is selected as the optimizer for its adaptive learning capabilities and effectiveness with image data. Staying cautious due to the client's first training round, a local_epochs count of 2 allows reasonable training iterations without over-consuming resources. The batch size of 64 is optimal for the client's high-resource capacity, balancing training speed and gradient update stability. A dropout_rate of 0.3 is included to provide regularization without excessively constraining learning capacity, addressing the risk of overfitting from the high capacity of the ResNet18 model. For the server settings, I've mirrored the client's learning_rate and momentum to maintain consistency across training, choosing AdamW again for its advantages in converging training processes with similar datasets. The mu value is set at 0.01, ensuring adequate FedProx regularization without overly constraining the local models. This parameter effectively controls the trade-off between global and local model learning, allowing sufficient focus on local data while still maintaining a global model structure.",

Since the last `learning_rate` was 0.001 and is optimal for this task, I will keep it the same for stability. Increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0001 is necessary to combat any potential overfitting, as the guidance suggests a higher `weight_decay` if training accuracy remains significantly higher than test accuracy. The `momentum` will remain at 0.9 to provide smooth convergence while ensuring robust training. For the optimizer, 'AdamW' is retained for its adaptability and performance. The `scheduler` is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR', enabling adaptive learning rate decay, which works well for image classification.

Therefore, I will recommend reducing the learning rate slightly to 0.0004 to help with overfitting. The weight decay remains at 0.0002 for regularization as there is no indication of severe overfitting to necessitate an increase. The optimizer choice remains 'AdamW' as it has been effective.

The client's previous results indicate stable performance improvements with minor adjustments in hyperparameters. Based on a trend in the client's history, the latest test accuracy is 80.93%. This suggests potential for enhancement, particularly looking at the peer (Client 196) who achieved better performance. The peer used a slightly lower learning rate (0.0005) with SGD, indicating that a conservative adjustment could be beneficial. Therefore, I propose to decrease the learning rate to 0.0005 to potentially enhance learning stability. I will also increase the weight_decay to 0.0006 to combat any overfitting observed previously. The batch size is set to 256 to align with high-resource capabilities while being responsive to accuracy improvements. For the dropout rate, I will modestly raise it to 0.3 to promote better generalization without causing significant information loss. The server parameters will remain consistent with the previous successful runs, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 and using Adam for optimization, as it was beneficial previously, while keeping mu at 0.01 to maintain regularization strength.",

Their weight decay of 0.0005 is also recommended for regularization, helping to prevent overfitting in potentially low training data contexts, so I will choose that as well.

For weight_decay, I will use 1e-04 to add regularization without being overly aggressive.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the client's first round and they are in a low-resource cluster, it is crucial to choose conservative hyperparameters. I selected a lower `learning_rate` of 0.0005 to enhance stability in the training process, given that low-resource clients may struggle with larger updates. For `weight_decay`, I settled on 0.0001 to provide a slight regularization effect without being too aggressive, which could impair learning; this value is at the lower end to encourage learning while still providing overhead for regularization. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that helps in stabilizing the velocity of descent in optimization. I opted for the `AdamW` optimizer since it generally offers better performance on image data compared to SGD, allowing for efficient weight updates. The `scheduler` is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually decrease the learning rate over epochs, aiding in convergence. I suggested a `local_epochs` value of 2, balancing the need for sufficient local learning while being efficient, and a `batch_size` of 16, small enough to suit the low-resource capability without sacrificing too much learning stability. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2, which should help mitigate potential overfitting on the low-resources immediately and avoid an overly aggressive regularization that could hinder learning. On the server side, I chose the same `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and `optimizer` as the client to maintain consistency, and set the `scheduler` to 'None' to avoid additional complexity given there are no previous rounds to learn from. Lastly, I set `mu` to 0.01, a middle-ground value that should effectively balance client updates without overly weighting any single client's contribution.",

    "reasoning": "The client previously used a learning rate of 0.0005, which performed well with a test accuracy of 79.19%. To optimize further based on the guidance for stable training on low-resource clusters, I have adjusted the learning rate to 0.0003, which is closer to the upper limit of the allowed range for this client but is still conservative enough given the constraints. This adjustment aims to improve convergence without risking significant instability. The weight decay has been set to 0.0001 to maintain regularization benefits without excessively penalizing the model weights. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as this has been effective in previous contexts. I selected the 'AdamW' optimizer because it combines adaptive learning with weight decay regularization, which is beneficial considering the classification nature of the task. The scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' which can help in refining training towards the end of the epochs. The local_epochs remain at 2 for stability, and I have chosen a batch size of 16, which is consistent with the prior selection. The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting given the high previous accuracy. For the server parameters, I retained the learning rate at 0.0005 for consistency, which permits good updates while keeping a lid on fluctuations. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain performance. The optimizer and scheduler choices are consistent with those used in the client side, promoting harmonization in updates. The value for mu is set at 0.01 as it is well within the allowed range and can help maintain client participation balance in the SplitFed scheme.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client, we need to select hyperparameters that allow for initial experimentation without overwhelming the model or the system capacity. Given the moderate resource of the client, I selected a `batch_size` of 32 which balances the number of data points processed without demanding too much memory. For `local_epochs`, I recommend 2 epochs to allow sufficient training without overloading a single round. Following the guidance for image classification, and considering no previous performance history to suggest a specific need for alteration based on overfitting/underfitting, a `learning_rate` of 0.001 is reasonable to start with, allowing for gradual updates during training. I selected the SGD optimizer as it's commonly robust in terms of convergence for such tasks, coupled with a `momentum` of 0.9 to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The `weight_decay` is set to 0.0001, which is low enough for initial exploration but provides some regularization to prevent overfitting. The `dropout_rate` of 0.2 strikes a balance to help mitigate overfitting by randomly setting 20% of the activations to zero during training. On the server side, I maintained parity with the selected optimizer and parameters. I set the server `learning_rate` also at 0.001 and used `momentum` of 0.9, as it aligns with the client's optimizer choice. The `scheduler` is left as 'None' to simplify initial deployment. Lastly, setting `mu` to 0.01 provides a moderate regularization effect via FedProx, allowing the client to explore while still maintaining some degree of control over divergence in a federated learning environment.",

    "reasoning": "Since this client is operating in a high-resource cluster (Cluster 2), they can handle larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates. Peer 495, which had a good accuracy (81.55%), used a learning rate of 0.002 and a batch size of 128. To optimize for potential overfitting given the nature of the task and the peers' performances, I suggest a slightly higher learning rate of 0.0025. Additionally, I'll set the weight decay to 0.0001, which is manageable for a high-resource client and aligns with common practice in handling overfitting issues in image classification tasks. Given the successful optimization approach from peer history, I will set the momentum to 0.9 and choose 'AdamW' as the optimizer, as it is currently popular and effective for image tasks. The local epochs will be set to 2.0 and batch size to 128 to leverage the available resources effectively. The dropout rate is set to 0.3, indicating a reasonable regularization without significantly impacting performance. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client’s choices to ensure consistency, with a learning rate of 0.001 and using 'AdamW' with 'None' for the scheduler since it's typically stable in federated settings. The mu value is set to 0.05, informed by peer use but adjusted for proportional balance, considering performance results across peers.",

Client 360 and Client 385, both of whom achieved competitive accuracies (80.26% and 82.36% respectively), employed reasonable hyperparameters. Following the split-fed central model strategy and keeping in mind that this client is resource-constrained, I will select a lower learning rate to ensure stable training. I'll set the `learning_rate` to 0.0003, which is the same as those used by peers, thus keeping it conservative yet effective. The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0001, a common value that aids in regularization, especially useful when overfitting might be a concern. Given the low-resource nature of the client, I will choose a `batch_size` of 16 to balance memory consumption and convergence speed while ensuring that they can still handle the load. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 to allow sufficient training without overwhelming the clients. A `dropout_rate` of 0.4, used by peer clients, will help mitigate overfitting. Overall, these choices maintain the integrity of the training process while adapting to the client's constraints. For the server side, I will mirror Client 360's hyperparameters to ensure consistency in updates, using `learning_rate` of 0.0003, `momentum` of 0.9, `optimizer` set to 'AdamW', and setting the `scheduler` to 'None'.

The weight decay has generally been gradually increased; I will edge it closer to the maximum permissible 0.001 to help mitigate overfitting tendencies, given the increased dropout rates toward end epochs. A momentum of 0.9 has shown consistent performance, and I will retain it. The use of AdamW optimizer has been beneficial, so I will keep it for both the client and server. The dropout rate has typically been adjusted upwards to 0.4; I will increment it to the upper limit of 0.5 to enhance regularization, given the increasing training capacity of the client. The batch size of 128 was previously successful but not allowed now, thus I will use 256 for enhanced batching on a high-resource client. A local_epoch of 2 is suitable and consistent with previous use. On the server's side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 for consistency and stability. The momentum (0.9) and optimizer type will remain unchanged. I will set the mu value at 0.01 based on previous consistency, situating it well within the allowed range.",

    "reasoning": "The test accuracy (69.97%) suggests that the model is performing decently, but there may be room for improvement. Following the guidance, since the client is in a low-resource environment, we want to prioritize stability and avoid high learning rates that could harm training performance. I will set the learning rate to 0.0001, the minimum value, to ensure stability while training on the client side. Since the previous weight decay value was 1e-05, I will keep it at the same level because it has not triggered overfitting issues yet, and it supports regularization without being overly aggressive on these limited resources. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' due to good performance with non-convex optimization landscapes typical in image classification tasks. The local epochs will be set to 2 to balance training duration and the number of updates. Considering the low-resource context, the batch size will remain at 16, as the previous configuration was stable. Lastly, the dropout rate is set to 0.3 to avoid overfitting while allowing the network to learn sufficiently. For the server, I suggest keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and using the same optimizer and momentum. The server's learning rate is still within the allowed range and supports effective global model updates. The scheduler will remain 'None' to prevent unnecessary complications.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client, there's no prior data to analyze performance, which means we aim for a balanced starting point. I selected a moderate learning rate of 0.001, which is within the limits for CIFAR10 image classification tasks, allowing for gradual convergence. For weight_decay, I chose 0.0001, a small value that favors learning without severe regularization since we don't have evidence of overfitting yet. A momentum of 0.9 is a well-known choice in deep learning as it effectively helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction while smoothing out the updates. I opted for the AdamW optimizer, which is suitable for image tasks due to its advantages in weight decay handling and adaptive learning rates. The learning rate scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to adaptively reduce the learning rate throughout training, which is helpful in optimizing convergence times. For local_epochs, I chose 2 as a balance between sufficient training and resource management, given the client’s medium capacity. A batch size of 32 is further reflective of the medium-resource context to optimize training stability without overwhelming the client. The dropout_rate is set to 0.1 to prevent overfitting—a typical approach for image classification tasks, including structural regularization. For the server, I mirrored the client's choices in learning rate and momentum, selecting AdamW as the optimizer for consistency between client and server, and set the scheduler to 'None' as we are focusing on the initial start without over-complicating things. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is moderate enough to ensure regularization without making it too dominant at the onset.",

    "reasoning": "The client has been working within a learning_rate of 0.0005, and while this was effective at one point (79.63% accuracy), the current constraints require us to lower it for better control (the acceptable range for learning_rate must be between 0.0001 and 0.0003). Since last improvements came with higher weight_decay, I will set that at 0.0004 to help with potential overfitting from previous runs. Additionally, I will use Adam optimizer, as it has been consistently effective in prior configurations. Given the client's moderate resource level and the need to manage model complexity, I suggest a batch_size of 32, which has shown effectiveness in past configurations, alongside a local_epochs of 2 to maintain training efficiency without overloading resource capacity. The dropout_rate will be slightly higher than previous at 0.35 to further help regularization. For the server settings, maintaining the learning_rate at 0.0005 does not adhere to the constraints, so I will set it to 0.0003 for optimal performance while ensuring stability during updates. The momentum will stay at 0.9 and I will opt for the optimizer AdamW for continuity. The mu will stay at 0.01 for effective FedProx regularization based on recent peer performance metrics.

    "reasoning": "The client's last training run on Epoch 39 achieved a test accuracy of 81.20%, suggesting the model is generally performing well and may be close to optimal. Given that the previous settings included a learning rate of 0.001, we want to keep this modest approach, as increasing it beyond 0.0005 could lead to instability. I will choose a learning rate of 0.0005 to strike a balance between effectiveness and controllability. As for the weight decay, I will keep it at 0.0001 since there’s no indication of overfitting; both accuracies need to be monitored closely, but no adjustment is needed at this point. The momentum is maintained at 0.9, which provides sufficient velocity for optimization while adhering to the constraints. The 'AdamW' optimizer is kept for its adaptive capabilities. The scheduler remains 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for gradual learning rate decay, aiding convergence. For client configurations, I will choose a batch size of 64, as the client has a medium capacity and this can help improve stability during training. The number of local epochs is set to 2 because we want to balance training time with the risk of overfitting, and retaining a dropout rate of 0.2 seems reasonable as it has already been tested, balancing between risk of overfitting and model complexity. For the server settings, we will replicate the learning rate of 0.0005 with ‘AdamW’ to ensure that server-side training aligns with the client. The momentum is kept consistent at 0.9, and I suggest using 'None' for the scheduler as server parameters typically do not require fine-tuning at this stage. Finally, I will set mu at 0.01 to maintain a regularization effect on the federated learning dynamic while staying within the given constraints.",

However, given the task nature and the provided guidance, we need to focus on fine-tuning hyperparameters to avoid overfitting. The previous learning rate of 0.001 is quite high considering the constraint and can lead to overfitting in combined federated settings. Therefore, I suggest reducing the learning rate to 0.0005 to promote a more conservative training approach. For weight decay, we will keep it at the minimum (0.0001) since the model isn't showing severe overfitting symptoms. The momentum will be maintained at 0.9 since it has previously been effective. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' for consistency, while the 'None' scheduler can be appropriate given that rate scheduling may induce instability in a federated learning environment.

However, given that the client's learning rate is at 0.001, which is on the lower end of the spectrum, I will slightly increase it to 0.002 to allow for more aggressive learning without risking divergence. The weight decay of 0.0005 is reasonable but could be increased to provide better regularization, especially because historical patterns show that high learning rates without proper weight decay tend to lead to overfitting in other clients. Therefore, I will set it to 0.0007. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 as it has been consistent in prior configurations. The chosen optimizer will remain SGD since it's proven effective in past trials, and the scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' helps in controlling learning rate decay well. The local_epochs will remain at 2, which is in line with prior configurations, and the batch_size of 128 is optimal for the high-resource client. I will slightly increase the dropout_rate from 0.2 to 0.3 for better regularization given the potential for overfitting with the new learning rate and adjustments. For the server, maintaining its learning rate of 0.001 allows synchronization with the client, and keeping the optimizer as AdamW complements SGD on the client side, providing a balanced convergence strategy.

The dropout rate is also increased from 0.3 to 0.4 based on the peer's successful use of a dropout rate that helped improve their accuracy.

Client 396 had 83.07% accuracy using a slightly higher learning_rate of 0.002 and weight_decay of 0.0008.

    "reasoning": "To optimize the hyperparameters for the image classification task using ResNet18 on CIFAR10, I considered both the client's historical performance and peer performance. The client achieved a peak test accuracy of 82.44% with values closer to the lower end of the learning rate range. Observing peer performance, particularly Client 359, who used a higher learning rate (0.004) and managed to achieve competitive accuracy, suggests that we can experiment with a slight increase in the learning rate. Given that the client has been using a relatively conservative learning rate of 0.0005, I recommend increasing it to 0.001 which is still within the suggested range but more aggressive. Additionally, the optimal weight decay from the client's history has been 0.0005, which helps mitigate overfitting – maintaining it promotes stability in training; therefore, I will keep it the same. The momentum will remain at 0.9, as this has proven effective across various peer tests. Switching from the Adam optimizer to AdamW used by peers might yield better results, thus I will suggest that change. For the batch size, given the high-resource capacity of the client, opting for a slightly larger batch size of 128 can facilitate gradients computation more efficiently. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.3 has been effective for the client historically, consistent with avoiding overfitting. The server settings will mirror the client's previous settings with slight adjustments to maintain synchronization. The mu parameter will remain at 0.01 to match performance.",

The dropout rate has shown improvement from 0.2 to 0.3; I'll keep it at 0.3 as it balances between retaining significant features and preventing overfitting. The batch size will remain at 32 due to the medium-resource cluster capacity. Additionally, since the client has not exhausted their capacity (local_epochs = 2.0), I will keep it the same. For the server parameters, the learning rate is kept at 0.001 and the optimizer at 'AdamW', aligning with previous configurations without causing any issues. Finally, the value for 'mu' is left at 0.01 to continue the regularization sweep without alteration, given that it's in the acceptable range. Overall, these adjustments aim to enhance performance while adhering to the observed patterns and constraints.",

However, given the past struggles and the application of 3 actions to refine the search space in previous experiments with the client, I recommend a more aggressive approach. Since the test accuracy is hovering just below 83%, it indicates potential overfitting when the training accuracy is notably high. Based on this, I will opt for a lower learning rate of 0.0001 to refine the model weights more delicately. Additionally, I will maintain the weight decay at 0.001, which should provide regularization without being excessively strong. With respect to dropout, I've noted increases in dropout rates reaching 0.3 with no observable detriment to performance, thus I will boost it slightly to a maximum of 0.35 for better generalization. For the optimizer, 'SGD' has been consistently utilized with no explicit indication to shift; therefore, I will retain it. A batch size of 256 is suitable given the high-resource capacity of the client, ensuring effective gradient updates without overloading memory.

    "reasoning": "Based on the client history, the previous attempts show variations in test accuracy from 66.83% to 79.95%. The highest test accuracy was achieved with a learning rate of 0.0005, weight decay of 0.0001, and a dropout rate of 0.3 at one point. However, in the necessary constraints, a lower learning rate between 0.0001 and 0.0002 is now required. To maintain some level of performance while adhering to the constraints, I will choose the lowest learning_rate of 0.0002, which is more aggressive yet still complies with overfitting concerns. 

Additionally, the weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to impose stricter regularization, helping to potentially mitigate overfitting issues observed previously. The momentum will remain at 0.9, per common practice, as it balances exploration and convergence well. The optimizer will be set to 'AdamW' as it has been performing adequately in the client's previous experiments, and the scheduler will remain 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for a decay in the learning rate over time, promoting better convergence.

For the batch size, I will choose 24 as it is within the bounds and aligns with the client's previous usage while fitting the constraint requirements. A dropout_rate of 0.4 has been effective in earlier tests, so this will be carried forward, as it helps combat overfitting. 

On the server side, I will maintain a learning_rate of 0.003 for better performance since the bounds allow adjusting towards the higher limit, which should benefit convergence on the server's end. Like the client, momentum will remain at 0.9 and the optimizer will also be 'AdamW', fostering consistency. The scheduler will again be 'None' since that offers a straightforward approach for regular updates during training. Finally, the mu value will be set to 0.01, keeping it consistent with the client's past parameters, ensuring effective FedProx regularization.",

Instead of larger batch sizes, I will maintain a batch size of 32, which fits into the medium-resource capability of the client. Lastly, for the server, I will set the learning rate at 0.001, which is consistent with its prior use, and retain the current optimizer and scheduler choice, ensuring uniform strategy throughout.

Given that both training and testing accuracies are currently unknown, a cautious approach should be taken. I will start with a moderate learning rate to prevent both overfitting and underfitting. A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal as it is generally recommended for image classification tasks and allows the model to converge without overshooting. For weight decay, I will set it to 1e-04, providing light regularization without being too harsh since there are no observed signs of overfitting yet. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a common choice that aids in smoothing out optimization paths. I will use 'AdamW' for the optimizer as it has shown great performance in image tasks due to its adaptive nature and ability to handle sparsity. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually adjust the learning rate, promoting better convergence. As this is the first round, a local epochs value of 2 is reasonable, allowing the model to learn sufficiently without overloading the client. A batch size of 64 is selected, which is also a common practice for balancing training speed and model performance. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.3 is reasonable, adding regularization to mitigate overfitting risks as the model begins to learn. For the server, I will mirror the client’s learning setup to ensure consistency during federated learning; hence the learning rate remains at 0.001, and the optimizer and scheduler are kept the same as the client's.

I have chosen a lower `learning_rate` of 0.001 to stabilize training, which is important for weaker clients to avoid divergence. The `weight_decay` is set to 1e-05 to provide some regularization without being too aggressive, as the client might need to prioritize learning from the data without excessive penalty. I've set `momentum` to 0.9, which is a common choice that helps improve convergence speed while avoiding overshooting. For the optimizer, I selected `AdamW`, which tends to perform well with image classification tasks due to its adaptive learning rate and regularization capability. The `local_epochs` is set to 2 — this allows sufficient updates while being mindful of resource constraints. A `batch_size` of 16 is chosen to ensure the client can handle the computations without running out of memory, given their low capacity. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2 to help with generalization while avoiding excessive dropout, which could hinder the learning process during the first round. On the server-side, I've opted for a `learning_rate` of 0.001 and `momentum` of 0.9 with the same optimizer `AdamW`, promoting consistency. The scheduler is set to 'None', leaving the learning rate fixed as the initial rounds are usually exploratory.

The trend suggests that further lowering the learning rate could yield better results, but I must adhere to the constraint of between 0.0001 and 0.0002 for the current epoch. Therefore, I suggest a learning rate of 0.0002 as a conservative choice. The weight decay was previously set to 0.0005, which is effective in addressing overfitting, but to stay within the allowed range, I will select the maximum of 0.001, aiming for stronger regularization. Momentum remains at 0.9, consistent with prior performance and within the constraint. The optimizer will stay as ‘Adam’ based on previous results and its effectiveness in training. Since the local epoch count is already at the maximum (2), I will retain this for consistency. The batch size will be set to 32 to allow more stable updates given the moderate capacity of the client. Lastly, the dropout rate set at 0.3 provides a good balance, being neither too high to demonstrate underfitting nor too low to increase overfitting risk. For the server, I will use a learning rate of 0.0005, maintaining stability as seen in previous approaches. The same momentum of 0.9 and 'Adam' optimizer aligns with effective server-side training.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the first round for the client, we can start by analyzing peer performance. Client 288 achieved a test accuracy of 81.19% using a learning rate of 0.0003, weight decay of 0.0005, and a batch size of 24. This suggests that a moderate learning rate and small weight decay are effective without leading to overfitting. Client 485, on the other hand, employed a different set of parameters with a lower learning rate of 0.0001 and achieved lower accuracy, indicating potential underfitting. Therefore, we suggest a balance between the two peer approaches. 

    For the client-side hyperparameters, I recommend a learning rate of 0.0003, which is consistent with the successful configuration of client 288. Weight decay will be set at 0.0005 to maintain a level of regularization without overcomplicating the model for this initial round. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as it is common in successful optimizations. Since this is a medium-resource client, a batch size of 16 is chosen to strike a balance between model training efficiency and resource utilization. A local epoch of 2 will help the model learn effectively within the hardware constraints. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 keeps the model from overfitting given that we can expect some level of noise inherent in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    For the server-side, I will use a learning rate of 0.0005, which is consistent with peer client experiences and ensures that communication updates from the server are neither too aggressive nor too conservative. A momentum of 0.9 and optimizer 'Adam' will also be used for its effectiveness in training CNNs. I suggest 'None' for the scheduler to keep things straightforward in this first round.

    Finally, the mu value for FedProx regularization is suggested at 0.01, close to the peer values we observe, allowing for effective coordination while maintaining performance stability.",

However, there's a pattern in the drop of accuracy, particularly when the learning_rate decreased to 0.0001. This suggests we may be nearing the limits of effectiveness for the learning rate. Since their current learning rate (0.0001) is at the lower bound, I will keep this value to consolidate and refine training. The weight_decay was incrementally increased and currently stands at 0.0007, which is beneficial for regulating potential overfitting. However, I will increase it slightly to 0.0008 to enhance this effect. The dropout rate has helped prevent overfitting, as indicated by its increase to 0.4 regularly, and I'll maintain this value for consistency. The local_epochs will stay at 2 given the medium-resource context. For batch_size, maintaining 16 is ideal, reflecting both the history and the required constraints. The server parameters suggest that the learning_rate can remain at 0.0005, a stable value that can facilitate ongoing refinement in line with the recent history.

The learning rate is set to a moderate value of 0.001 which balances between too aggressive and cautious, as aggressive learning rates can lead to poor convergence. A weight decay of 0.0001 helps to prevent overfitting without overly restricting the model capacity. A momentum of 0.9 is a common standard that aids convergence. The chosen optimizer is 'Adam', which tends to perform well for image classification tasks due to its adaptive learning rate properties. The scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to effectively adjust learning rates during training, which can enhance model performance over epochs. We will use a local batch size of 64—optimal for high-resource clients—and a dropout rate of 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting risks, allowing the model to generalize better. The server parameters mirror the client's recommendations for consistency and are also set to a learning rate of 0.001, with the same optimizer and momentum.

Analyzing peer performance, it is evident that lower learning rates are yielding better results, particularly in peer 288’s case with a learning rate of 0.0003 resulting in 81.19%. Therefore, to optimize performance while adhering to the constraints, I suggest lowering the learning rate to 0.0004. I'm also maintaining the weight decay at 0.0005, which has been effective so far. The dropout rate gets a slight alteration from 0.4 to 0.3 to aim for better generalization without risking overfitting. For the optimizer, I recommend switching to 'Adam' since peer 288 showed promising results by doing so, possibly enhancing convergence speed given the current settings. The batch size is set to 32, which is stable and in the middle of the range, offering a balance between speed and gradient estimation efficiency. Therefore, the final parameters for the client side are established with a learning rate compatible with potential underfitting and a dropout rate that strategically addresses any overfitting.

We will stick with the same scheduler, 'CosineAnnealingLR', which is beneficial for gradually decreasing the learning rate. Only two local epochs will be kept as it's moderate enough for the client’s capacity, while the batch size remains at 32 which is optimal for a medium-resource client.

I will select a moderate learning rate of 0.001 as it balances convergence speed and stability, fitting within the low-resource client setup. For weight decay, a value of 1e-05 will provide light regularization which is important for image classification tasks while still allowing the model to learn effectively. I am opting to use the Adam optimizer, which is typically robust for image classification tasks and can adapt the learning rates for the parameters automatically. The scheduler is set to 'None' since it's the initial training round, making it straightforward. I will choose a batch size of 32, which is a reasonable setting for medium-resource clients, and set local_epochs to 3 to allow the model to learn adequately from the local data. A dropout rate of 0.2 is chosen to mitigate any potential overfitting right from the start, which is common with deeper architectures like ResNet18. For the server, I will mirror the client's learning rate, momentum, and optimizer for consistency in training dynamics.

Following the guidance, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 0.0007 to help regularize the model and mitigate overfitting. The client's previous learning rate of 0.001 is too high for optimal performance, so I will lower it to 0.0005 since both the training and test accuracies are lower than desired. The optimizer will remain 'Adam', as it's effective for these tasks, and I will retain 'None' for the scheduler to maintain simplicity. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 as previously used, keeping computation reasonable for the medium-resource cluster, while the `batch_size` remains at 32 which balances training efficiency and memory. Finally, I will increase the `dropout_rate` from 0.2 to 0.3 in light of the extended performance history which suggests a need for greater dropout to combat overfitting.

Lowering the learning rate from 0.001 to a more conservative 0.0005 might help reduce the risk of overshooting the optimal solutions, given that the current accuracy, while respectable, suggests there may still be room for improvement. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0001 will introduce more regularization, potentially mitigating any overfitting that could arise from a high learning rate. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it strikes a good balance without causing instability. Using the AdamW optimizer can provide better generalization in image tasks compared to plain Adam or SGD, hence I will suggest that. The scheduler could be changed to 'StepLR' to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on training progress. Since the current local_epochs (3) is appropriate for the client's medium-resource capabilities, I will maintain that. The batch size of 32 is complying with the given constraints, so I will opt for 64 (the other option available) to potentially improve gradient estimation. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3, providing more robustness against overfitting. For the server parameters, the learning rate will also be set to 0.0005 to align with the client's updated rates, momentum remains at 0.9 with the AdamW optimizer and the same scheduler to maintain consistency in training dynamics.

The weight decay will be set to 1e-05, which is towards the lower bound but helps with regularization. Given that the peer's use of AdamW did not perform as well and the client is in a low-resource setting, I will stick with SGD as it has worked reasonably well previously. The momentum is set to 0.9, following the client's history which has used this value effectively. As for the local epochs, keeping it at 2 will allow sufficient training time without overburdening the low-capacity client.

For the server settings, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as it remains well within the constraints and is a common choice for stabilizing training.

I opted for 3 local epochs to maximize training engagement given the high-resource capability of the client, and a batch size of 128, which aligns with the peer's capability. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is chosen as a moderate compromise to prevent overfitting without losing essential features during training. For the server-side, I mirrored the learning rate and optimizer settings from the client to maintain consistency in training. The server’s momentum remains at 0.9 to help with convergence. Since there’s no guidance suggesting the need for a scheduler on the server side, I set it to 'None'. Finally, I set `mu` to 0.01, which is within acceptable bounds and helps in controlling the regularization for FedProx without being too strong.",

However, the learning rate is approaching the upper limit of the allowable range.

Hence, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.005 to allow the model to fine-tune without overshooting minima in the loss landscape. The weight_decay is currently at 0.0001, which is on the lower end, but given that our test accuracy is good, maintaining it at 0.0001 should suffice since the model is not exhibiting signs of overfitting. Maintaining the current momentum of 0.9 will help effectively navigate the loss landscape. I will retain the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has shown good performance, and I'll set the scheduler to 'None' because no adjustments seem necessary at this point. The local_epochs are kept at 2.0 within the allowed range, suggesting a decent balance between training time and performance improvements. With respect to batch_size, for a high-resource client like Cluster 2, I will increase it to 256 since the model can handle this larger size effectively. The dropout_rate is increased slightly to 0.25 from 0.2, which can help further regularize the model without significantly hurting performance. For the server parameters, given the client’s last settings, I am going to maintain a learning_rate of 0.001 to ensure that updates from clients remain effective but conservative, as our test accuracy needs to be robust across all clients.

Also, I'll increase weight_decay slightly to 6e-05 to combat potential overfitting since test accuracies can only get so high without regularization. The momentum will stay at 0.9, which has been consistent with past performance. I'll select 'AdamW' as it appears to have provided good results, and maintain a local_epoch of 2 as it balances between training time and learning. The batch_size stays at 64 because larger sizes were not previously tested, and a dropout_rate of 0.3 aligns with the past success while preventing overfitting effectively.

    "reasoning": "The client's recent performance indicates a slight improvement in test accuracy with a learning rate of 0.0015 but not significant enough to further increase it, given the potential for overfitting. As the last few epochs have shown a test accuracy plateau around 82.07%, it might be prudent to maintain a similar learning rate rather than risk overshooting with a higher value. The current weight decay of 0.0009 seems adequate; however, considering the observed gains in test accuracy at 0.0008 by a peer, a slight adjustment down to 0.0008 should help with regularization without dramatically changing the learning dynamics. The batch size can be increased to the maximum of 256 to leverage the high-resource capacity of the client, which would improve its speed without compromising performance, as both previous trials with batch sizes of 128 and 256 yielded similar test accuracies. The dropout rate remains at 0.3 to mitigate overfitting tendencies as consistent high training accuracy coupled with lower test accuracy might suggest overfitting. Regarding the server settings, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 ensures stability across the federated learning setup since test accuracies of peers using slightly higher server learning rates have marked decreases in the last rounds, and a consistent momentum of 0.9 helps ensure stability. The `mu` value remains at 0.05 as it has proven effective in balancing the local disadvantage of the split federated scheme.

Given the recent peer's success with similar parameters, it indicates that a slight adjustment could yield better results.

Since the client is categorized as a low-resource client, I will keep the batch size at the lower limit of 16 to ensure stable training while also conforming to the client's previous usage. The learning_rate of 0.00025 is outside of the client constraints, so I will adjust it down to the maximum allowable of 0.0002 to ensure efficacy without causing instability. I will increase weight_decay to 5e-05, aiming to combat any potential overfitting suggested by the close test and training accuracies. A dropout_rate of 0.4 was beneficial previously and should be retained for effective regularization. For the server, I'll select the same learning_rate of 0.0002 with the AdamW optimizer and none for the scheduler, consistent with past performance.

However, to potentially improve the model's generalization and further enhance test accuracy, I will decrease the learning_rate to 0.0005, which can help minimize overfitting by making more subtle adjustments during training. Additionally, I will increase the weight_decay to 3e-05 to add regularization and mitigate overfitting, as the test accuracy is not significantly higher than the training accuracy. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 as previously used, as it is within acceptable bounds and has likely contributed positively to the performance. The choice of the optimizer will switch to AdamW for better weight decay handling. The local_epochs are set to 2, which is moderate for the model training size, and the batch_size will be reduced to 32 to accommodate the medium resource capacity. The dropout_rate is increased to 0.3, as this increased level should help with overfitting. On the server-side, I will also choose a learning_rate of 0.0005 for consistency with the client parameters and setting the momentum to 0.9 as it aligns with effective practices.

Increasing the dropout rate to 0.4 has shown promising results, which appears to help against overfitting, thus it will be reverted to this level. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' because that is consistent with successful trials, and a scheduler of 'CosineAnnealingLR' will be retained to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training.

    "reasoning": "The previous experiments revealed that increasing the learning rate within the allowed range was necessary, as both cases yielded similar accuracies (around 82%), with the highest accuracy being 82.69% for a peer with lower learning rate and a slightly different configuration. Therefore, I will try a learning rate of 0.0015, which is the maximum possible within the given range, to allow for potentially better convergence. Additionally, to prevent overfitting, I am raising the weight decay to 0.001, also the maximum allowable value, which is supported by the fact that the client's previous best accuracy has not improved significantly. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which is standard practice for 'AdamW.'. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' is ultimately effective given its benefits for deep learning tasks, particularly with CNNs like ResNet. I will maintain the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler since it was utilized before without issue. The local epochs should remain at 3 for maximal training without resulting in saturation, plus a batch size of 128 as it has been working well, and I will increase dropout to 0.5 to induce further regularization, given that it's permissible. For the server hyperparameters, maintaining the same learning rate of 0.001 is reasonable as it ensured stability and consistency was there, along with the proactive adjustment of enabling the same optimizer scheme, 'AdamW' that the client uses for continuity. The mu parameter will be set to 0.05, allowing for moderate FedProx regularization based on the beneficial outcomes observed previously.",

Additionally, I will retain the weight decay of 0.0005 to help with potential overfitting indicated by their history of fluctuating accuracy.

The local_epochs will remain at 3, maintaining the maximum allowed for higher update frequency, but the batch_size will be set to 16 as it's the only option that can provide a balance of speed and stability for low-resource clients. The dropout rate will stay at 0.4 as it has shown effective in the client's previous configuration.

This suggests that a lower learning rate may help enhance convergence and stability. The weight decay was consistently set at 0.0002 over the last few epochs, supporting the idea that a modest level of regularization is beneficial. For dropout rate, 0.4 has shown to contribute positively to the performance without severe overfitting as evidenced by the increases in accuracy up to 80.12%. Thus, I recommend slightly raising the batch size to 64 for potentially enhanced computational efficiency while adhering to client resource constraints. The local epochs remain at 3 to ensure adequate training time. For the server parameters, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is reasonable given it served well historically, while weight momentum and optimizer choices remain unchanged at default values known to function effectively in this context.

    "reasoning": "The model's last test accuracy of 82.39% indicates that it is performing reasonably well but may still benefit from adjusting hyperparameters based on the recent trends and peer performance. Notably, other clients have experimented with varying learning rates and weight decay, achieving similar accuracies. Given that 'Client 264' saw better results with a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0005, I will keep this learning rate for consistency and potential stability in training. However, to address any potential overfitting (as seen in previous runs), I will slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0003, which is still within the allowed range and could help regularize the model further. The chosen optimizer remains 'Adam' due to its strong performance in previous epochs. I will also increase the dropout rate to 0.4 (from 0.3) as a preventive measure against overfitting, given the high-capacity cluster's ability to manage this. For the batch size, I'll use 128, which balances efficiency and performance. Lastly, I will keep the server-side learning rate consistent at 0.001 with the 'Adam' optimizer, which has proven effective, while increasing mu to 0.02, aligning with a peer's approach who achieved slightly better performance with a similar structure. Maintaining these adjustments aligns strategy with history while adhering strictly to constraint ranges.",

{
    "reasoning": "Given the recent history of the client's performance, with the last test accuracy reaching 82.96%, it's clear that they are very close to optimal performance levels. However, there is a slight pattern of underperformance due to similar configurations being used by peers leading to slightly lower accuracies. The client has used a learning rate of 0.001 previously, which is at the higher end for the allowed range. In analyzing the performance of peers, I noticed that a higher learning rate (with adjustments in weight decay as needed) has not consistently yielded better results, suggesting that a lower learning rate might be beneficial to stabilize training and allow for better convergence. Therefore, I will maintain the learning rate at the maximum allowed (0.0005) to ensure stable yet effective learning. To combat overfitting, the weight_decay will be adjusted slightly higher to 0.0006. The optimizer choice will remain as SGD because that has proven successful in previous configurations, and I will keep the dropout_rate at 0.3 since it appears to be a sweet spot for balancing capacity and generalization. The local_epochs will remain at 2 to maintain training duration while batch size continues to be 128 for effective processing by the client. As for the server, I will suggest keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 since it has not shown any signs of overfitting or underfitting across peers, thus ensuring stability and reliable performance across federated rounds. For the global parameter mu, I will set this to be 0.02, the same as used in previous configurations, which has yielded promising results. Overall, these parameters are geared towards maximizing training effectiveness while controlling for potential overfitting.",
