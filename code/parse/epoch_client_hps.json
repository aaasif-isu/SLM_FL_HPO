To address this, I will increase the learning rate slightly closer to the maximum allowed within constraints, which would allow for potentially faster convergence and improved performance. Setting `learning_rate` to 0.0005 aligns with avoiding issues faced by low-resource clients since it is at the upper limit of what's permissible, but still small enough for stable training. Regarding `weight_decay`, while it helps with overfitting, the model did not show signs of overfitting yet, thus I will keep it relatively low at 0.0001. The dropout rate is already at a standard 0.2; maintaining this should help maintain a balance between regularization and learning capacity. For the number of local epochs, I will select 2 to ensure the model trains effectively without overwhelming the low-resource capacity of the client. I will choose a batch size of 16 as it is within constraints and allows for efficient gradient updates considering the low-resource context. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' for its balance of performance and stability, which is especially beneficial in these environments. Moving to the server parameters, I will maintain the same learning rate and momentum values to ensure consistency in training dynamics across clients and the server, utilizing the same optimizer ('AdamW') since it is a good fit for federated learning setups. The mu parameter will be set to 0.01 as it sits comfortably within acceptable limits for FedProx regularization.",

Additionally, a weight decay of 1e-04 is chosen to provide a small amount of regularization without overly restricting the model's learning capacity. Since the client capacity is low-resource, I am opting for a smaller batch size of 16 to ensure the model can train without overburdening the client\u2019s resources. I will set the local_epochs to 2 to allow the model to learn sufficiently from the data without overwhelming the client. The optimizer will be set to 'AdamW', which generally works well with image classification tasks. The dropout rate is set to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting without excessively limiting the model's learning capacity. For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is also suggested to maintain consistent training across clients, and I will select 'SGD' as the optimizer, which can benefit from being conservative in such federated learning scenarios. A scheduler of 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected to adjust the learning rate dynamically through epochs, which can help converge to an optimal solution.

This is relatively low considering the nature of the task and indicates a potential issue of either underfitting or overfitting. Since both accuracies are not sufficiently high, I will implement a strategy to encourage better learning. A higher learning rate can sometimes help in the case of underfitting, but given the constraints, the maximum I can set is 0.0005. Moreover, I will increase the weight decay slightly to address potential overfitting while ensuring it remains within permitted limits. Thus, I will set weight_decay to 0.0001. The momentum is set to a standard value of 0.9, which should provide stable updates during training. The optimizer remains as AdamW because it has provided reasonable results. I will keep the local_epochs at 2. Regarding batch size, 32 is less than 64, which is reasonable for medium-resource clients. Lastly, I\u2019ll increase the dropout rate to 0.2 to provide further regularization and combat potential overfitting. For the server parameters, I will retain a learning rate of 0.001 and the same optimizer 'AdamW', with a momentum of 0.9 and no scheduling, as it reflects the previous successful strategy.

I will set `weight_decay` to 1e-04 to provide some regularization while maintaining model capacity.

I will use the 'Adam' optimizer, known for better convergence behavior without needing too aggressive learning rates, and I will keep `local_epochs` at 2 to allow meaningful training while being manageable for medium-resource clients. The `batch_size` is chosen as 32 to balance computational load and gradient estimation stability. On the server side, I will mirror the client\u2019s choice of `learning_rate` at 0.001 to maintain consistency across training. I retain the `momentum` at 0.9 for effective convergence behavior within the federated scheme, which allows for some acceleration in updates. The optimizer will also be 'Adam' to ensure uniformity and effectiveness during federated updates. The scheduler is set to 'None', as we are starting fresh with no prior knowledge on learning decay strategies from this specific client. Lastly, I will set `mu` to 0.01, as it lies comfortably within the allowed range and provides a balance within the federated learning scheme, aiding in regulation without overwhelming the local models.",

To alleviate this, I will suggest increasing the weight decay, which acts as a regularization technique, to help reduce overfitting. Additionally, I will slightly lower the learning rate to bring more stability to the training process while avoiding drastic changes that could lead to underfitting. Given the high-resource nature of the client, I will maintain a larger batch size to maximize the training throughput, but keep it in the allowed set of values. For dropout, I will increase it to 0.3 to provide more regularization, aiming to further mitigate overfitting. The momentum and optimizer will remain consistent, as they have shown some reliability. The server parameters will also use a learning rate within range to ensure coordination with the client, with momentum and optimizer settings mirroring the client for consistency.

Hence, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to prevent overshooting and promote finer updates, targeting 0.0005, which is conservative yet allows for exploring the learning dynamics carefully. I will also increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 to encourage regularization and mitigate overfitting since the current performance indicates that the model may be fitting to the training data too closely. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 is reasonable, and I will choose 'Adam' as the optimizer since it often performs well for image classification tasks. The local_epochs will remain at 2 to ensure that the client can make adequate updates while the batch_size will be increased to 128, taking advantage of the high-resource capability. The dropout_rate will be set to 0.4 to further combat the overfitting seen in the client's history. For the server's settings, the learning rate will match the client's to provide consistency in weight updates, and I'll keep the momentum at 0.9, using 'Adam' as well for a uniform approach across client and server updates.

I will use 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler, as it was previously applied and is suitable for dynamic learning rate adjustments. For local training, I will keep the local_epochs at 2 since it strikes a balance between computational efficiency and training depth. The Batch Size will remain at 128, a power of 2 that maximizes the clustering capacity of the high-resource client while allowing effective gradient updates. Lastly, I will increase the dropout_rate to 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting while keeping it within the specified range. For the server, I will maintain a consistent learning rate of 0.005 and momentum of 0.9 alongside the 'AdamW' optimizer, with the same 'CosineAnnealingLR' to synchronize behavior across federated clients.

The recent test accuracy of 54.83% suggests potential for improvement, and as this is a low-resource client, I will keep the batch size at 16 while opting for a dropout rate of 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting. Since the client's training setup ultimately needs to afford stability due to limited resources, a weight decay of 1e-04 will be employed for better regularization. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW', which already showed reasonable performance. The local epochs will be kept at 2 to balance training time against learning. The server parameters will also reflect a moderate learning rate of 0.001 with a similar momentum of 0.9, along with the 'AdamW' optimizer to maintain consistency; no scheduler will be included to manage computing needs effectively. The mu parameter will be set to 0.01, which supports regularization in the FedProx scheme while not being too conservative. Overall, these selections balance the need for stability due to resource constraints with the potential for model improvement based on past trials.",

Momentum is set at 0.9 as it is a commonly used value that aids in stabilizing training. I chose the Adam optimizer, which generally performs well across various tasks, including image classification. The local_epochs are capped at 2, allowing for reasonable training without overwhelming the client capacity. The batch_size is set to 16, a conservative choice suited for low-resource clients to keep memory usage in check. The dropout_rate is recommended at 0.3 to add regularization without overly hindering the model's learning capacity. For the server side, I suggest the same learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, using the Adam optimizer for consistency in training dynamics across the client and server.

I will set a moderate `learning_rate` of 0.001 to ensure stable convergence without overshooting optimal weights, which is especially important for medium-resource clients. For `weight_decay`, I will choose 1e-04 to help prevent overfitting, balancing model capacity and generalization. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, a common choice for helping accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. The optimizer will be 'SGD', a widely used method that generally performs well for image classification tasks. The `scheduler` will be set to 'StepLR' to reduce the learning rate at specific intervals, which helps fine-tune the training as it progresses. Given the resource constraints of Cluster 1, I will set `local_epochs` to 2 and `batch_size` to 32 for a good balance of training stability and throughput. The `dropout_rate` will be set to 0.2 to help combat overfitting without excessively hindering learning. On the server side, I will align the learning rate, momentum, optimizer, and scheduler choices with those of the client to maintain consistency in the training process.

Lowering the learning rate is not advisable due to the potential for underfitting. Instead, I will adjust the parameters for better optimization. I will set the learning rate to 0.0005, which is the highest allowed in the constrained range, to enhance the model's learning process. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to prevent overfitting since ResNet models can easily overfit on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has proven effective in the past. The optimizer will be switched to AdamW for better regularization, which can help with the learning dynamics. I will continue using a batch size of 32 because it is within the allowed options, although I need to choose either 16 or 24; I will choose 24 to optimize resource usage. Dropout will be increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting, given the previous configurations. On the server side, I will mirror the client's learning rate because this balance can potentially lead to better performance in federated learning scenarios. The server weight and optimizer will remain the same because it's customary to maintain consistency to avoid drastic shifts in performance. Lastly, I will adjust 'mu' to 0.01 to regulate the FedProx term, striking a balance that encourages local model training without diverging too much from the global model's performance."

Given that this client operates on a high-resource cluster, they can handle a more aggressive learning rate. Therefore, I'll set the learning rate to 0.001, which is a common choice for stable training in similar tasks. To prevent overfitting without historical validation, I will also apply a moderate weight decay of 0.0005 for regularization. A momentum of 0.9 is a standard choice that helps accelerate gradients in the relevant direction, improving convergence speed. For the optimizer, AdamW is selected for its effective performance on image classification tasks, managing weights well by decoupling weight decay from the gradient updates. Use of a learning rate scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR) can help gracefully adjust the learning rate throughout training, promoting better convergence. The local epochs are set to 2 for a balanced approach between training efficiency and convergence rate. Lastly, a batch size of 64 is a strong choice to optimize the utilization of resources without overwhelming memory capacity. For dropout rate, I'll use 0.3 for a balance in regularization while still allowing for learning. On the server side, a compatible learning rate of 0.001 with a similar momentum (0.9) and the same AdamW optimizer ensures consistency in training dynamics. The scheduler is set to None, insofar as the server typically does not require dynamic adjustments for global parameter updates.

Therefore, I suggest lowering the learning rate to 0.0005, which is the maximum allowed to encourage closer exploration towards potential optimal points. Additionally, an increase in weight_decay to 0.001 will help combat overfitting. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is appropriate as it has been consistently used in the past, promoting stable convergence. The optimizer remains set to 'SGD', which has been validated through usage. A dropout_rate of 0.3 is an effective choice, offering a balance between too little regularization and preventing overfitting. The local_epochs remain at 2, suitable given the client's medium-resource constraints and previous usage. For the server parameters, I suggest using a learning rate of 0.0005, the same as the client, to promote cohesive training, with a momentum set at 0.9 and 'SGD' as the optimizer, since it aligns with prior performance evaluations. Lastly, I propose a mu value of 0.01, helping to control the FedProx regularization term and ensuring a balance in federated learning.

The learning rate in the client's history was set at 0.001, which is somewhat on the higher end within the allowed range, so I will lower it slightly to 0.0005. This adjustment should promote stability and performance improvement by preventing potential overshooting in parameter updates. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 from 0.00005 helps mitigate overfitting, especially since the training scenario involves a powerful client cluster which may sharpen focus on generalization. The momentum remains at 0.9, as it has been effective for the client thus far. The optimizer will stay as 'AdamW', given its strong performance and compatibility with dropout strategies. I'll recommend batch_size of 64 and local_epochs at 2.0 since they align with the client's processing power and should ensure efficient training cycles. Additionally, dropout_rate is increased to 0.3; this moderate rise will help prevent overfitting without severe loss of expressiveness. On the server side, I recommend keeping the learning_rate at 0.001, as a consistent value that has been part of their configuration. The server also benefits from maintaining the same optimizer ('AdamW') and momentum (0.9) to ensure parameter update coherence. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, consistent with previous configurations to balance local updates with global learning.",

The momentum will be kept at 0.9, as it\u2019s effective for convergence without adjusting the learning dynamics drastically. The optimizer will remain 'Adam' since it stabilizes training with lower learning rates. The local epochs (2) are reasonable to ensure enough training time without overwhelming the client resource limits. A smaller batch size (16) will be maintained to accommodate the low-resource nature of the client, and a dropout rate of 0.2 is sufficient to help mitigate overfitting while allowing enough capacity for learning. On the server side, I will align the learning rate closely with the client at 0.001, as this should facilitate smoother communication in federated learning.

Therefore, I will choose the highest possible value within the limits, which is 0.0003. This provides a sufficiently high learning rate that is still conservative. The weight_decay will be set to 1e-05, the lowest value available, to minimize regularization initially, as there is no indication of overfitting from previous results. Momentum will remain at 0.9, which aligns with the peer history and is a commonly effective value for momentum. For the optimizer, I will also use 'Adam', consistent with the client\u2019s history to promote stability. The local_epochs will be set to 2 as this matches the client's previous setting with reasonable local training while limiting conflict from overfitting. The batch_size will be 16, which is the only option given the constraints that the client can handle. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.2 was previously used, and this value is reasonable to start with, as it balances between allowing the model to learn patterns and preventing overfitting. For the server, I will use a slightly higher learning_rate of 0.001 (the maximum allowed) to increase the global learning capacity while retaining stability. The momentum for the server will also be 0.9, and I will stick with 'Adam' as the optimizer for consistency and performance. The scheduler is chosen as 'None' to keep things straightforward for both client and server deployments.

The learning_rate is set to 0.001, which is a standard choice that balances the capacity for learning and stability. The weight_decay is set to 1e-04 to introduce some regularization while avoiding overfitting without prior indications of problems. A momentum value of 0.9 is chosen as it is a common best practice to speed up training and help the optimizer overcome local minima. The optimizer selected is AdamW, as it provides better handling of weight decay compared to Adam and should aid in performance for image classification tasks. A local_epochs value of 3 is decided upon to allow for sufficient learning in the model given the capacity constraints of the client. The batch_size is set to 32, which is an efficient compromise between resource consumption and training effectiveness. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is recommended to help mitigate any potential overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during the training phase. For the server, the learning_rate is also set to 0.001 to ensure stability in the aggregation process. The momentum remains at 0.9, and AdamW is used consistently with the client optimally. The mu parameter is chosen at 0.01, providing a moderate amount of regularization in the federated learning setting which should enhance performance without significant penalties in client update frequency.",

However, given the strict constraints, I will utilize the highest learning rate option at 0.0005, which is still conservative relative to the usual settings. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 helps in regularizing the model, which may mitigate potential overfitting, especially considering that ResNet models generally need such regularization. For optimization, 'AdamW' remains a suitable choice given the client historically used it and has likely benefitted from its adaptive learning capability. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 to maintain stability in learning. The dropout rate is set to 0.4, which offers a good balance for regularizing the model while allowing it to learn complex features. The batch size of 24 is chosen as it lies within the constraints and balances training time with resource use. The server's configuration will mirror the client's choices where applicable, using a learning rate of 0.001 to ensure steady global learning. I will use the 'StepLR' scheduler to adjust learning rates in a way that can stabilize convergence over many epochs.

A moderate learning_rate (0.001) is a good start for image classification tasks to allow for effective training without overshooting minima. I will keep the weight_decay relatively low at 0.0001 as a starting point to prevent over-regularization and still allow the model to learn. The momentum is set to 0.9 for effective optimization. I will choose the 'AdamW' optimizer as it generally performs well in image classification tasks by combining the performance of Adam with weight decay. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow dynamic adjustment of the learning rate over training. The local_epochs is set to 2, which strikes a balance between training thoroughly and not overspending resources since the client is in a medium-capacity cluster. A batch size of 64 is an appropriate choice to accommodate the model's learning without overwhelming the client\u2019s resources. A dropout rate of 0.1 will be introduced to combat any potential overfitting while still allowing the model to recognize important patterns in the data. On the server side, I will mirror the learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 using the 'AdamW' optimizer, also utilizing 'None' for the scheduler, as adjusting the learning rate for the server is not as critical during the initial run. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, which aligns with the guidance for a moderate degree of regularization in federated learning.",

The chosen learning rate of 0.001 is at the high end of the acceptable range, and further increases could lead to instability, especially given the medium-resource capacity. To combat potential overfitting (if high train accuracy were evident), we could consider increasing the weight decay to support regularization; I'll set it to 0.0005 to see if it helps in improving generalization. I'll also moderate the learning rate to 0.0005, which is within constraints and might help improve stability and convergence. Given that the batch size of 64 was previously used, it remains within the acceptable space for medium-resource clients, allowing for manageable gradient updates. The dropout rate remains at the lower bound of 0.1 to facilitate learning without significant reduction in capacity. For local epochs, I will maintain it at 2, which allows sufficient training without overloading the client's resources. For the server, I suggest the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate also of 0.001, consistent with the client to ensure convergence alignment without increasing complexity. The momentum of 0.9 is retained as it is proven to assist in smoother optimization paths. Lastly, I will keep mu at 0.01, as it was functioning correctly in the last analysis.

As per the guidance, a higher weight_decay can help in mitigating overfitting as indicated by the disparity between training and test accuracies. Therefore, I suggest increasing weight_decay to 0.0003. The confidence in higher batch sizes comes from the client's high-resource status, so adjusting the batch_size to 128 is a logical choice since it is the only available option within the constraints (256 being non-selectable based on historical performance). The optimizer remains 'AdamW' for its adaptability. For the server settings, I recommend maintaining a learning_rate of 0.001 as well to ensure consistency. The momentum remains at 0.9 for stability.

Given that this is a relatively high learning rate for a low-resource client, it's likely this could lead to instability in training. Therefore, I will suggest a lower learning_rate of 0.0005 to ensure more stable convergence. The weight_decay was set at 1e-05, which is quite low; to mitigate potential overfitting I will increase it to 5e-05. The momentum value of 0.9 appears good and I will maintain it. For the optimizer, I will stick with 'SGD' as it is a reliable choice for image classification tasks. The local_epochs will be set to 2, which seems reasonable given the client's resource constraints. The batch_size will be 16, which is appropriate for the low-resource scenario, and the dropout_rate remains at 0.2, which seems optimal based on previous results. For the server, I will retain the configurations as they were effective previously; the learning_rate will be set to 0.001, momentum to 0.9, optimizer to 'SGD', and scheduler to 'None' to keep things straightforward.

To address this, I'll suggest increasing the `weight_decay` to provide more regularization. The previously used learning rate of 0.001 is within the acceptable range but might need to be reduced slightly to promote better training stability, particularly for low-resource clients. Thus, I have chosen a learning rate of 0.0005. Given the low-resource capacity of the client, I will keep the `batch_size` at 16 and `local_epochs` at 2 to maintain stable training while limiting resource consumption. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting. For the server, I will also opt for a learning rate of 0.001 alongside `AdamW` optimizer and `StepLR` scheduler to match the client's approach and provide consistency in training. The `mu` value will be set to 0.05, striking a balance between personalization and global model training.",

Regarding weight_decay, I'll increase it to 5e-05 to help avoid overfitting while remaining within constraints. The optimizer will stay as 'SGD' to maintain consistency. The momentum will be set to 0.9, as shown to work in training. The batch_size will remain at 16 since it has previously been used without issues. I will also maintain a local_epochs count of 2 for similar reasons. The dropout_rate will increase slightly to 0.4 to further combat overfitting, staying within bounds. The server's learning_rate can be higher at 0.001 while still remaining competitive. Lastly, mu will be set at 0.01, as it's the same as before and can provide stability during federated learning.",

Since the task is image classification using ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, higher accuracy requires defining the correct hyperparameters. Given that the client has used a learning rate of 0.001, which is the higher end of the client\u2019s constraint range, and is perceived to be possibly too high for the current client capacity, I suggest a lower learning rate of 0.0005. This will mitigate convergence issues and allow for more stable training. The weight decay has been set to 0.0005, which is still low but is higher than previously used; this should help to regularize the model and combat potential overfitting. The momentum remains at 0.9, as this has shown stability in previous iterations. I suggest keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW', as it is effective for this type of model and task. The local epochs are set to 2 to provide reasonable training without overwhelming the client. I opted for a batch size of 16, the maximum allowable for low-resource clients to help with stable training. Lastly, I increased the dropout rate to 0.2 to further combat overfitting, since higher dropout rates have been instrumental in increasing validation accuracy in similar tasks. For the server, I maintained the learning rate at 0.001 with similar rationale, ensuring it stays optimally effective for the federated scheme, using the same momentum and optimizer settings as the client to maintain consistency across updates. The mu is set to 0.01 to provide an intermediary degree of regularization in the federated setting, balancing client updates with stable generalization.",

The previous weight_decay of 0.0005 is reasonable, but increasing it slightly to 0.001 will help further regularize the model and combat overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to ensure stable updates during training. Given that the client capacity is medium, a batch_size of 32 is a suitable choice to balance performance and resource constraints, while setting the local_epochs to 2 remains effective for moderate training on this architecture. The dropout_rate will be increased to 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting as we've observed some signs of it. For the server's hyperparameters, the learning_rate will be set to 0.001, which is a good value within the specified range and supports the model's convergence in a federated setting, keeping momentum at 0.9 and using 'AdamW' as it is effective for this kind of gradient descent. The scheduler will be set to 'None' as there's no previous usage pattern of schedulers that shows effectiveness.

The recommeded learning_rate is set to 0.001, within the specified range of 0.0001 to 0.01, which strikes a balance to prevent overfitting while promoting adequate learning speed. As the client is in a medium-resource cluster, a batch_size of 32 is optimal for their capacity, allowing enough samples per gradient update without overwhelming resources. Since there is no previous history of overfitting or underfitting, I will set weight_decay to 5e-04 to add some regularization, allowing the model to generalize better. The momentum is set to 0.9, a standard value that typically helps to accelerate convergence in SGD. The optimizer will be AdamW, which is suitable for image classification tasks and includes weight decay as part of its regularization. For the scheduler, 'StepLR' will be used to adjust the learning rate during training. The local_epochs is set to 2 to ensure sufficient learning without excessive computation. The dropout_rate is set to 0.2, providing a moderate level of regularization to combat potential overfitting without hindering the model's ability to learn. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client settings for consistency, especially since this is the client's first round. Thus, I'll also use a learning_rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, and 'StepLR' as the scheduler.

Therefore, I chose a lower `learning_rate` of 0.001, which is within the specified range, allowing for gradual convergence. For `batch_size`, I selected 16, as smaller batches can help with the stability of training on weaker hardware. The `weight_decay` is set to a small value of 1e-05 to help combat potential overfitting without overly constraining learning. I opted for the 'SGD' optimizer as it is effective for image classification tasks and works well with lower learning rates. The `momentum` is set at 0.9, which is a common choice that helps accelerate gradients during training. I chose to implement `CosineAnnealingLR` for the scheduler, as it can dynamically adjust the learning rate over time, helping with convergence. For dropout, I set it at 0.2, a moderate level, aiming to reduce overfitting while still retaining enough capacity to learn. The server has similar parameters, with a `learning_rate` of 0.001, momentum at 0.9, and 'SGD' optimizer for consistency. The `scheduler` on the server is kept as 'None' for simplicity. The `mu` parameter is set to 0.01, which is a moderate choice for the FedProx regularization, benefiting the federated setup while remaining conservative enough not to hinder learning.",

To improve upon this, I need to make adjustments while ensuring compliance with their medium-resource situation. Given that the learning rate was previously set to 0.001, I will reduce it to minimize overfitting risks as per the guidance, selecting a value of 0.0005, the upper limit of the recommended range. Additionally, the weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to provide better regularization. The momentum will be kept at 0.9, as it is effective for convergence without being too aggressive. I will change the optimizer to 'AdamW', which is often favorable for better handling of weight decay. The batch size will remain at 32, optimal for the current resource constraints. The local epochs will be set to 2 in alignment with the client's history to prevent overly long training times. To mitigate overfitting while balancing the learning capacity of the model, I will slightly increase the dropout rate to 0.4. For the server settings, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, aligning with the trend of consistency observed. I will choose 'SGD' for the optimizer as it tends to work well in federated contexts. For the mu value, I will set it to 0.05, which is a reasonable middle ground to balance the local updates and the global model training.",

Since the test accuracy is relatively high at 70.87% but we must caution against overfitting, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0005, which is still on the higher end of the range and should help with stable convergence. The weight decay I will adjust to 0.0005; it is higher than the previous value and should mitigate overfitting without causing underfitting. The momentum will stay at 0.9, which is optimal for momentum-based methods and is known to help with convergence speed. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', as it is effective for this kind of image classification task with ResNet architectures. I will choose 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the scheduler as it is known to progressively lower the learning rate and can help improve accuracy further, especially when starting at a higher learning rate. I will keep the local epochs at 2 due to moderate resource capabilities and the batch size at 32 is already set, which is within allowed parameters. Lastly, I will raise the dropout rate slightly to 0.4 to further combat overfitting since we are concerned with the accuracy disparity. On the server side, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, with AdamW as the optimizer and 'None' for the scheduler, as there is insufficient need for adjustment in a federated setting at this moment.

Since both training and test accuracies were relatively close, the possibility of minor overfitting exists, hence I will maintain weight_decay at 0.001, the maximum allowable to assist in regularization. The momentum will be set at 0.9 as it has worked previously and is within the specified range. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' for its compatibility with image models, while using 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler will allow for adaptive learning rate scheduling through training; it has shown beneficial effects in similar tasks. For local_epochs, I will keep it at 2 to balance training time with the complexity of the model. Given the capacity of the cluster (Medium-Resource), I suggest a batch size of 32, however, the available options are 24, so I will select that as it is still likely sufficient to handle the task. Lastly, I'll set the dropout_rate to 0.2, as it is beneficial to mitigate overfitting while respecting the constraints.

Setting the learning rate to 0.001 balances the initial exploration\u2014this rate is neither too high (which could cause divergence) nor too low (which may slow convergence). A weight decay of 0.0001 will help regularize the model but still allow it to learn effectively. With a moderate momentum of 0.9, it should facilitate convergence. For local epochs, choosing 2 offers a good compromise between training time and model performance given the medium resources. A batch size of 64 is efficient and appropriate for the cluster's capabilities. Lastly, I will set the dropout rate to 0.1 to help mitigate overfitting while still allowing the model to learn intricate features in the images. For the server, a similar approach will be taken; the learning rate and optimizer match the client to maintain consistency in training dynamics, with a momentum of 0.9.

Given that the previous learning rate (0.001) is within the lower threshold but may be slightly conservative, I suggest decreasing it to 0.0005 to allow for more gradual convergence. Additionally, I'll increase the weight decay to 0.0005 within the accepted limits as there might be slight overfitting. The momentum remains at 0.9 since it has shown stability in trials. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' and retain the same scheduler (None), as there hasn't been substantial evidence to change these. Given the moderate resource capacity (Cluster 1), keeping `local_epochs` at 2 will help maintain efficiency and the batch size at 64 is on the higher end to allow for better generalization of features. I will increase the dropout rate slightly to 0.2 to help mitigate any signs of overfitting, balancing it with maintaining learning capability. For the server-side, I will keep learning rate at 0.001, momentum at 0.9, optimizer as 'AdamW', and scheduler as None, since these parameters have proven effective.

Therefore, I propose to increase the learning rate to improve the ability of the model to learn from the data effectively. However, it must still remain within the allowed range. I will increase the learning rate to the upper limit of 0.0005. To help mitigate any potential overfitting while improving capacity, I suggest keeping the weight decay relatively low at 0.0001. Since the last setup indicated a major reliance on the Adam optimizer, I will maintain that choice for consistency. The globalization approach allows for increased local epochs, and given the client's high resource capabilities, I'll set the local_epochs to 3, which should assist in maximizing the learning from the dataset. For the batch_size, I'll opt for 40 as a reasonable middle ground within the constraints without sacrificing learning efficiency. Given a consistent dropout rate of 0.2, I will retain it to balance the model's complexity. For the server, the learning rate will also be set to match the client's chosen strategy at 0.0005. I am choosing the momentum of 0.9 for the server as it is a commonly stable choice with Adam. Lastly, I will select the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler to adjust the learning rate dynamically over training cycles and keep `mu` at 0.01 to maintain a level of regularization on the federated updates during training.",

Additionally, a batch size of 16 is selected, which is manageable for low-resource clients. To prevent overfitting, a weight decay of 0.0001 is implemented. Considering the client's needs and to aid generalization, a dropout rate of 0.2 is applied, which is moderate and in line with common practices for CNNs. The optimizer is chosen as 'AdamW' since it performs well on image classification tasks, and for momentum, I have selected 0.9, as it is effective for faster convergence without fluctuation. Finally, a 'None' scheduler is applied since this is an initial round and monitoring the learning progress is essential without imposing additional complexity. On the server side, I have mirrored the learning rate, momentum, and optimizer from the client side to ensure consistent training propagation, with the scheduler set to 'None' for simplicity.

To address potential overfitting, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 5e-05 to help regularize the model without destabilizing the training process. Given that the client's capacity is low-resource, I will slightly lower the `learning_rate` to 0.0005 to ensure training is stable; it's at the higher end allowed which should help with underfitting. The choice of `Adam` as the optimizer is based on the fact that it adapts the learning rate during training, which can be beneficial in a low-resource setup. Maintaining a `momentum` of 0.9 should help accelerate SGD in the relevant directions. The `local_epochs` will be kept to 2 since it's a reasonable number for balancing between convergence and resource constraints. The `batch_size` is set to 16, which is viable for clients with limited resources. Lastly, the `dropout_rate` is maintained at 0.2 to provide some regularization but not too much, ensuring the model continues to learn effectively. For the server parameters, I will use a learning rate of 0.001 as it is a common choice that balances stability and convergence in federated settings. The `momentum` is also set to 0.9 to keep consistency with the client's approach. Using `AdamW` for optimization at the server level reflects good performance in similar tasks.

Therefore, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0005. The weight decay of 0.0001 is low; I will increase it to 0.0005 to enhance regularization and potentially combat overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it\u2019s within the optimal range and works well with AdamW. Regarding the optimizer, I will retain AdamW for its proven efficiency in training deep models. I will maintain the local_epochs at 2, which is balanced for a medium-resource client. The batch size of 64 is optimal for this client's capacity, allowing for effective training without excessive memory usage. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to further mitigate any chances of overfitting while still retaining enough model complexity. On the server side, the learning rate of 0.001 seems optimal as it aligns with the previous configuration. The momentum remains at 0.9 for consistency. I will also retain AdamW as it has worked well with the client model. Finally, I opt for a 'None' scheduler given that it simplifies initial trials while adjustments are made.

To improve learning, I will increase the learning_rate to its maximum value of 0.0005, since a higher learning rate often helps correct underfitting by allowing the model to learn more quickly from the data. For weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0005, as having a slight regularization can prevent overfitting while maintaining capacity to learn. The optimizer remains as 'Adam', which has generally performed well in similar architectures. I will also keep the momentum at 0.9 as it is a common choice for stability without being too aggressive. The batch size will remain at 64, which is manageable for medium-resource clients like this one. The dropout_rate is also increased to 0.3, slightly reducing the model's capacity to help with regularization while avoiding overfitting. On the server side, I will maintain similar learning_rate and momentum values as the client's choices to ensure alignment, retaining the optimizer as 'Adam' since it's often effective in federated learning settings.

Given that client resources are moderate, I will select a batch size of 32, which strikes a balance between resource utilization and effective learning. For the learning rate, I will set it to 0.001; this is typically a good starting point in image classification tasks, enabling the model to learn effectively without overshooting the optimal parameters. I will use AdamW as the optimizer, which combines the benefits of Adam with weight decay regularization. Considering that we are aiming to mitigate potential overfitting in the first round, I will set the weight decay to 0.0001, which is mild yet effective for regularization. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a standard value for many optimizers, enhancing convergence stability. As for epochs, a value of 2 is selected to allow for sufficient learning without overwhelming the model given the limited capacity. The dropout rate will be set to 0.2, which can help to prevent overfitting while maintaining the model's ability to learn. On the server-side, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum for consistency across the training process, using the same AdamW optimizer with no scheduling to simplify the approach. Finally, for the mu value, I will set it to 0.01, falling within the allowed range, which adds a controlled regularization influence across the federated setup.",

I will suggest increasing the learning rate close to the upper limit, to 0.0005, as the client is high-resource and can likely handle a more aggressive approach. Keeping weight_decay at 0.0001 would help maintain regularization without going too high, which could lead to underfitting. Additionally, I will keep momentum at 0.9 and maintain 'AdamW' as the optimizer, which is effective for training CNN architectures like ResNet. I will also retain a dropout rate of 0.3 as it has been previously set, balancing model robustness without excessive regularization. The local_epochs will be kept at 2, aligning with prior successful configurations. For the server, I will suggest keeping the learning_rate at 0.001, the same as before, ensuring consistency across federated learning, along with 'AdamW' optimizer and no learning rate scheduler to simplify the strategy.

However, it is crucial to ensure the learning rate is adjusted conservatively to mitigate overfitting behavior while optimizing. Hence, I recommend reducing the learning rate to 0.005. The weight decay is currently set to 0.0005, which is appropriate but can be increased to 0.001 to introduce stronger regularization and address potential overfitting. The dropout rate is at 0.3, which is reasonable, but I will maintain it to balance complexity.

The previous weight decay of 0.0001 can remain the same as it is within the acceptable range and has not been reported to hinder performance. For momentum, I will use 0.9, which is standard practice and was previously utilized. The optimizer will stay as 'Adam', as it is robust and fits well with CNNs. The local epochs will be set to the maximum value (3) to increase training time on each client while the batch size is kept at 8 due to resource constraints. Finally, I will maintain the dropout rate at 0.2 according to the previous test, balancing between preventing overfitting and ensuring the network can learn effectively. On the server side, I will also adopt a learning rate of 0.0005 for consistency. The momentum will also be set to 0.9, following the same rationale as for the client. The optimizer will remain 'Adam' for continuity. The scheduler can be set to 'None' as no scheduling was previously reported to be in use and might not benefit under current training conditions.

The weight decay is set to 0.0002, the upper limit of the range as it supports regularization efforts to mitigate overfitting issues. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 as it has proven effective, and the optimizer will remain 'AdamW', which is already in use. The local_epochs will be set to 2, a balanced choice for training frequency which is reasonable in this medium-resource setting. The batch size can be maintained at 32, however, due to constraints, I will change it to 24 since that is the closest fit while still acceptable. The dropout rate, which can mitigate overfitting, will be increased to 0.3, allowing better regularization while being within the acceptable bounds. For the server parameters, I will set the learning rate to 0.001, as it's a commonly used value that suits model training, and maintain the 'AdamW' optimizer and 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler that have proven effective. The 'mu' value is set at 0.01, which will aid in the FedProx regularization while remaining within the suggested range.

The weight_decay is set to 0.0001, which is low, and since we want to avoid overfitting given the model performance, a slight increase to 0.0005 will help regularize the model better. The momentum is maintained at 0.9, which is generally a good practice for convergence. The optimizer is kept as 'AdamW', which has been effective in the past. The scheduler change to 'CosineAnnealingLR' might help with learning rate adjustments as the epochs progress, potentially improving the model's capacity to generalize. For local_epochs, we can increase it to 3 to allow longer training without overwhelming a medium-resource client. The batch size remains at 32, the only feasible option given client constraints and history. Lastly, since increasing dropout rate may help combat potential overfitting, raising it to 0.4 is suggested. For the server, the learning_rate can slightly increase to 0.002 to facilitate better learning feedback from the clients. The momentum is kept at 0.9 with 'AdamW' due to its historical effectiveness. The server scheduler remains at 'None' for simplicity. Finally, mu is kept at 0.01, which is within constraints and effective in prior configurations.",

The client's previous learning rate of 0.001 is already at the midpoint of the allowed range. Therefore, I will keep the learning rate. Given the client's moderate capacity and the fact that high learning rates can lead to underfitting, I will suggest a very conservative option at the lower end of the constraint to ensure stability. The weight decay of 0.0001 will be increased slightly to 0.0005 to help combat overfitting without being too aggressive, as it may not be necessary to manage high variance yet. The momentum remains at 0.9, as it is a standard value that usually helps convergence, and I will retain the AdamW optimizer since it has been performing adequately. I suggest increasing the dropout rate to 0.25 to better address potential overfitting where necessary. The local epochs will be maintained at 2, as this seems to be an effective balance for learning without excessive resource demands. The batch size will remain 32, as specified. For the server, the learning rate will also remain the same at 0.001 to maintain a stable federation, while I will keep momentum at 0.9, as this has been beneficial.

The weight decay will be increased to 0.001 to address possible overfitting due to observed accuracy discrepancies.

The dropout rate can be increased to 0.3 to enhance regularization without pushing too close to the upper limits, thus potentially leading to better generalization.

The guidance emphasizes the importance of the learning rate and optimizer choice. Since the client operates in a High-Resource setup, we can afford to use more aggressive settings. I opted for a learning rate of 0.001 which is moderate and should favor good convergence without risking instability. For the optimizer, I chose 'Adam' because it generally performs well in image classification tasks like CIFAR-10. The weight decay is set at 1e-04 to introduce some regularization without overly constraining the model's capacity. A momentum of 0.9 will help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, allowing for faster convergence. I selected a batch size of 64, which is suitable for high-resource clients, as larger batches can lead to more stable gradients. For dropout rate, I set it to 0.2 to help cushion against overfitting while allowing enough model capacity. The local epochs are set to 2 to allow for ample training while still fitting within limited communication rounds. For the server settings, I'm keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and using the 'Adam' optimizer with no scheduler, simplifying the training process at this stage.

I've increased the weight decay to 1e-06 to help prevent overfitting, adhering to the client's previous usage of lower weight decay. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 is beneficial, as it sits within the recommended range, and helps with convergence. I will continue using the SGD optimizer since it has shown promise in prior epochs. I've maintained the batch size at 16 and local epochs at 2 to accommodate the low resource capabilities without risking stability. Dropping the dropout rate to 0.2 maintains some regularization without being overly aggressive, which aligns with recent runs showing reasonable test accuracy without overfitting. For the server, I've kept the learning rate at 0.001 as it lies within the optimal range while maintaining consistency with historical values. The momentum and optimizer remain unchanged to avoid introducing new variables that could negatively impact the outcomes.

Lastly, I will set the dropout_rate at 0.2; it will help prevent overfitting while allowing sufficient capacity to learn meaningful patterns.

Given that this is a medium-resource client, we might need to slightly adjust hyperparameters. The learning rate is at the midpoint of the allowed range, which can be suitable, but to seek improvement, we will lower it to better control overfitting, thereby allowing more stable convergence. A weight decay of 0.0005 seems appropriate as it was the last used value; however, we consider an increase to 0.0007 to help with potential overfitting. The momentum remains at 0.9, as it is within bounds and effective. For the optimizer, we will switch to 'AdamW', which is generally better for performance in these networks, especially when combined with weight decay. We keep the local_epochs at 2 due to moderate resources, and the batch size will remain at 32 since it's efficient for training on CIFAR10. The dropout rate can be increased to 0.4 to potentially improve performance further. On the server side, I suggest keeping the learning rate at 0.001, maintaining momentum at 0.9, switching to 'AdamW', and using 'None' for the scheduler to simplify this round of training without additional hyperparameter interference.

However, considering the model is a ResNet18 applied to a cifar10 image classification task, I recommend a moderate learning rate to ensure stable training without overshooting. A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal for such tasks based on common practices. Weight decay is important for regularization, and I will set it at 1e-05 to prevent overfitting without being too aggressive, as the initial training phase often requires some latitude for learning. The momentum of 0.9 provides a sensible balance improving convergence speed while allowing some inertia in gradients. For the optimizer, 'Adam' is chosen for its adaptive learning capabilities, which can be particularly beneficial in early training phases. In terms of scheduling, using 'None' allows the learning rate to remain constant in the first run, which is a safer approach. For the number of local epochs, setting it to 2 aligns well with the need to adequately train on a medium-resource client. A batch size of 32 was selected, as this is a moderate size that accommodates both processing capacity and learning efficiency. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.25 is introduced to help mitigate potential overfitting during the initial epochs. On the server side, I maintain the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for consistency in training across the federated model, and I recommend using 'Adam' for its adaptive nature in managing global model updates. The learning rate on the server will also be static by opting for 'None' as the scheduler, thus facilitating a straightforward global training process.

Since this rate is already effective, I will suggest lowering the learning rate slightly to 0.0005 to ensure stability and avoid fluctuations in performance, as per the guidance for optimal learning rates in cases of achieving reasonable accuracy. The weight decay will be increased from 0.0001 to 0.0005 to enhance regularization, which can help mitigate any potential overfitting observed since training accuracy may be relatively high. The optimizer 'AdamW' has proven effective for the client, so I will retain this choice. A momentum of 0.9 is optimal as per prior usage and lies within the specified range. The batch size of 64 is retained, as Cluster 2 can handle it well. I will set the dropout rate to 0.3; this is within the effective range and can aid in reducing overfitting.

Thus, I will lower the learning_rate to 0.0005 to potentially improve the generalization on unseen data. The weight_decay of 0.0005 is appropriate for regularization, so I will keep it the same. The momentum of 0.9 is consistent with previous strategies, which have been effective, hence I will maintain that value. The optimizer remains as Adam since it has shown reliability so far. Increasing the local_epochs to 3 should allow for better convergence while the batch_size stays at 64 to maximize the processing capabilities of the client. I will also increase the dropout_rate to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting. For the server-side, I plan on keeping the learning_rate small at 0.0005, momentum at 0.9, and maintaining the optimizer as Adam.

Given that this is the client's first round and there is no prior history of overfitting or underfitting, we will use a conservative approach. The weight_decay is set to 0.0001 to encourage some regularization without overly penalizing the weights, which could be detrimental for these resource-limited clients. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is a common default known to improve convergence speed. The optimizer chosen is 'AdamW', as it is generally effective for various tasks and can help manage the training dynamics for image classification tasks. The scheduler is set to 'None' because starting without a scheduler is prudent for the first round, especially for a low-resource setup. Given that lower batch sizes often yield more stable updates in low-resource scenarios, a batch size of 16 is selected. A local_epochs value of 1 is chosen to allow for stable preliminary training, enabling the client to gain some insights without excessive resource use. The dropout rate is set to 0.2, which provides a reasonable balance between retaining model capacity and avoiding overfitting, but not too high to hinder learning too much. For the server, the learning rate is also set to 0.001 for consistency and stability across the training process. The momentum remains at 0.9, and 'AdamW' is used again for compatibility with the client's choice, ensuring that the updates align well. The scheduler choice is 'None' to keep the server's training straightforward during this initial phase.

The batch_size is set to 16, allowing for stable updates without overwhelming the limited client infrastructure. Lastly, I'm setting a dropout_rate of 0.35, balancing between enabling model regularization and learning capability. For the server parameters, I'm opting for a learning_rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, and maintaining the 'SGD' optimizer in line with effective settings used by peers.

However, to ensure stable training on a low-resource client, I will suggest a lower learning rate. Therefore, I recommend a learning rate of 0.0001, which is at the lower bound of the acceptable range. Additionally, the client should stick with the existing weight decay of 0.0003, as it has helped control overfitting in previous iterations. The learning rate and weight decay are within the appropriate ranges for ensuring stability in training on low-resource devices. A momentum of 0.9 is appropriate and consistent with previous setups as it can help accelerate SGD in the relevant direction. Keeping the optimizer as SGD is a good choice as it has been used successfully in prior configurations, thus continuity is essential. The dropout rate of 0.35 was effective previously, and will help in reducing overfitting while not increasing it beyond the current level. The local epochs are set to 2 as this value has previously proven effective without overconsuming client resources. The batch size is kept at 16 since it is the same as the client's past settings and fits within the low-resource constraints. For the server, I will maintain the server learning rate at 0.001 since it has been consistent in yielding acceptable performance. Using the same optimizer and momentum from the client settings helps maintain congruence across training efforts. Finally, a mu value of 0.05 will provide a moderate level of regularization in the federated learning scenario, making it a prudent choice."

Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.4 from 0.3 to further combat overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training. For the server, I will mirror the learning rate of 0.0005 and maintain the optimizer as 'AdamW', and I will retain the momentum at 0.9 for consistency.

The `weight_decay` will be set to 1e-04, which can help in regularizing the model since it will help to mitigate potential overfitting as we proceed with training. The `momentum` value of 0.9 is a standard choice that can help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. For the `optimizer`, I will choose 'Adam', as it adapts the learning rate based on the first and second moments of the gradients, which can benefit the training process effectively. The `scheduler` will be set to 'StepLR' to allow for learning rate adjustments at specified intervals, enhancing performance across epochs. Given the moderate capacity of the client, I will select `local_epochs` of 2 to ensure a good balance between training time and convergence, as well as a `batch_size` of 32, which is manageable and allows for effective gradient updates. Lastly, I will choose a `dropout_rate` of 0.2 to introduce regularization and help prevent overfitting while allowing the model to retain enough learning capacity. On the server side, the hyperparameters will mirror the client\u2019s to maintain consistency and optimization structure, particularly the learning rate and optimizer, set at 0.001 and 'Adam', respectively.

The client's last learning rate was set at 0.002, which is outside the allowed constraint range of 0.0001 to 0.0015. To align with the constraints, I will set the learning rate to 0.0015, the highest permissible value, to potentially gain better accuracy. The weight decay was 0.0005, which is within the allowed range, but could be adjusted slightly downwards to 0.0003 to balance between optimization and regularization. Since the momentum was at 0.9, I will keep it the same, ensuring strong convergence without being too aggressive. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW,' which is effective for handling adaptive learning rates, and I will continue with this choice. For the scheduler, since it was set to 'StepLR,' I will switch it to 'CosineAnnealingLR,' to allow for a more dynamic adjustment of the learning rate over epochs. The number of local epochs will remain at 2, as it\u2019s an appropriate count for the dataset, and I will keep the batch size at 64, consistent with the constraints. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to further help with any potential overfitting. On the server side, I will also set the learning rate to 0.0015 to maintain an aggressive approach matching the client's high-resource capacity. I will keep the momentum the same at 0.9 and use 'AdamW' for consistency. The scheduler shall remain at 'None' for simplicity in this context.

A weight decay of 0.0001 is intentionally low, offering slight regularization without significantly impacting the model's performance early on. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common standard that helps stabilize training. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen for its efficiency in handling sparse data and delivering faster convergence. The learning rate scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected to adaptively adjust the learning rate as training progresses, offering potential improvements in accuracy. A local epoch of 2 allows the model to learn adequately while not overspending compute resources. A batch size of 64 is optimal for high-resource clients, striking a balance between learning stability and computation. The dropout rate is set to 0.3, which is moderate and will help prevent overfitting as the model trains. For the server configuration, similar metrics are chosen as a precautionary measure, maintaining consistency in optimization strategies. The mu is set at 0.01, which aligns well within the recommended range for FedProx regularization, providing effective control over local updates.",

The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it is consistent with the previous settings and provides adequate acceleration in SGD. I will switch the optimizer to 'Adam' for improved convergence properties, especially since the previous use of SGD may not have maximized efficiency given the client resources. A local_epochs value of 3 pushes the model to learn more from the limited data available to this client. A batch_size of 8 will help keep memory usage down, suitable for low-resource clients. The dropout_rate will be increased to 0.3 as a precaution against overfitting when dealing with significant accuracy variance between training and validation sets. On the server side, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001, maintaining stability while still allowing for convergence, and will keep the momentum at 0.9. I chose the 'Adam' optimizer for the server as well, which is suitable for adaptive learning rates, and will use a 'StepLR' scheduler to adjust the learning rate dynamically.

This indicates that the hyperparameters have been somewhat effective but may still be optimized further. Since the learning rate used in earlier epochs (0.001) was too high for optimal performance, and the current learning rate (0.0005) seems close to its maximum threshold, I suggest reducing the learning rate to 0.0003, which is just under the recently effective value but remains well within the allowed range. This will slow down the learning process slightly, allowing more careful convergence on relevant features in the data. The weight decay is currently at 0.0005, which helps regularization. However, to mitigate any potential overfitting issues observed in the past (noted by the difference in accuracies), I propose increasing the weight decay to 0.001 to enhance regularization further. The dropout rate currently set at 0.1 seemed insufficient as evidenced by the results from peer 485 (0.4). To address possible overfitting and improve generalization, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.2, which should help balance training without overly hampering learning. The other hyperparameters such as momentum (0.9), optimizer (AdamW), and local epochs (2) remain appropriate given their consistency with successful configurations in peer setups. I will keep the batch size at 64, as it fits the client's medium-resource capacity while allowing effective training. On the server side, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001, as it remains effective for relevant stakeholders and is consistent with the past configurations. I will also retain the optimizer (AdamW) and momentum (0.9) for server settings, as they have proven effective.

For the server-side, I will mirror the client's settings closely to maintain consistency in learning rates and optimization dynamics, selecting a learning rate of 0.001 to allow for broader exploration while keeping the learning rate range reasonable.

To further mitigate any risk of overfitting (if present), I will increase the weight decay to 1e-05, which is still low enough to allow the model to learn effectively. Given the client's high-resource capacity, I will increase the batch size to 128 (the highest in the allowed list) for better gradient estimation and stability. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.4 to reduce potential overfitting on the given dataset. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' and use 'CosineAnnealingLR' for scheduling as it has previously shown some effectiveness. For the server parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 to maintain stability and consistency while training.

Additionally, I will maintain the weight_decay at 0.0001 as it has provided a good regularization effect without introducing too much constraint during training. As the client operates in a high-resource cluster, increased batch size allows better utilization of resources; hence I will set it to 128. For the optimizer, I will keep Adam as it generally performs well in image classification tasks. The local_epochs will remain at 2, as this has been reasonable in prior setups. To combat potential challenge with overfitting in the future, I will set the dropout_rate to 0.3, which provides a balance between retaining information and regularization. For the server, I will retain the learning rate at 0.001, ensuring it's conservative without being too low for effective communication during federated learning. The momentum will be kept at 0.9, and I'll maintain the Adam optimizer with the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler, which can help in adjusting the learning rate over time effectively.

Increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 will help in reducing potential overfitting, especially since the test accuracy isn't reaching higher levels. We will keep the momentum at 0.9, as this has worked well and is within the limits. Adam is known for its adaptive learning, so we will continue using it as the optimizer for the client.

We will set the local_epochs to 2 and the batch_size to 64, maintaining reasonable resource usage for a medium-capacity client. Increasing the dropout_rate to 0.3 may help prevent overfitting further and provide a better generalization. For the server, we will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 with Adam as the optimizer.

Choosing a learning_rate of 0.001 strikes a balance between exploration and convergence, which is suitable for CIFAR-10 image classification tasks when starting fresh. My choice of weight_decay at 1e-04 will help prevent overfitting, especially since ResNet18 can be prone to it in image tasks. The momentum is set at 0.9 to help stabilize learning and maintain speed during training. I recommend the 'Adam' optimizer, which is generally effective for image classification and can adapt learning rates for different parameters. A batch_size of 32 is selected as it fits within the medium-resource capacity, ensuring sufficient training data while maintaining reasonable memory constraints. Setting local_epochs to 2 provides a good number of training passes per round while not overburdening the client's capacity. The dropout_rate is set at 0.2, which will help reduce overfitting by randomly omitting an appropriate fraction of neurons during training. For the server-side parameters, I've mirrored the learning_rate and momentum values recommended for the client to maintain consistency. The same optimizer, 'Adam', will also be used on the server for coherence. The scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to facilitate a gradual decrease in the learning rate over epochs and allow the model to adapt better over time. Finally, I chose a value of mu at 0.01 for the FedProx regularization, providing a small yet effective control on the divergence between the client models in a federated scheme.",

For weight decay, I will set it to 1e-04, which provides a light regularization to combat overfitting without being too restrictive since no overfitting has been observed yet due to the absence of training history. Momentum will be set to 0.9, a standard choice that typically helps optimize convergence for CNNs. For the optimizer, I will select 'AdamW' as it is generally effective for image classification and can manage overfitting well when used with weight decay. The local_epochs will be set to 2, as this is suitable for medium-resource clients, allowing ample training without overburdening the system. The batch size will be 32, balancing the resource constraints with effective training, and the dropout rate will be set to 0.2 to help with regularization without excessively losing information. On the server side, the learning rate will also be set to 0.001 to match the client setup, with 'AdamW' as the optimizer for consistency.

This indicates that while training accuracy is likely solid (not confirmed), there are signs that overfitting may be occurring. Therefore, we will adjust hyperparameters to moderate this risk. We'll maintain a relatively low learning_rate of 0.0005 to ensure smooth training, as both accuracies show less than ideal improvement when moved higher. To combat overfitting, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to its upper limit of 0.0002, as higher regularization may help to reduce overfitting. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, continuing to allow for effective optimization. The optimizer stays on 'AdamW' as it has been successful historically. Since the batch_size options are limited and 32 isn't available, we'll select 24 as a reasonable alternative, ensuring we adhere to resource constraints and leaving headroom for computational efficiency. We'll also retain dropout_rate at 0.3 to further help with possible overfitting while staying below the maximum cap. For the server parameters, the learning_rate remains at 0.001 which is within a safe operational window conducive to collaboration during federated training. The momentum isn\u2019t modified and remains at 0.9, along with using 'AdamW' for the server's optimization to mirror the client for consistency in performance. We will keep the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler for flexibility in training progression, and lastly, set mu to 0.01 as this balances client contribution and regularization in federated learning effectively."

Therefore, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0005, which is still effective but aims to prevent possible oscillations. Regarding the weight decay, I will set it to 0.0003 to introduce slightly more regularization, as overfitting might be a concern given the relatively high training accuracy for a CV model. The momentum will stay at 0.9, which is standard and beneficial for convergence. The optimizer will be set to 'SGD' as it is effective for image classification tasks and well-suited for low-resource clients. I will suggest maintaining a batch size of 16 as it balances between efficiency and stability given the client's capacity. The local epochs can be set to 2 to provide additional training without overwhelming the system resources. Lastly, I recommend a dropout rate of 0.2 to help reduce overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server, I will suggest using the same learning rate of 0.0005, maintaining the momentum at 0.9 for stability, and keeping the optimizer as 'SGD', as this aligns well with the client setup.

To prevent overfitting and help with generalization, I will apply a weight decay of 0.0005, which is a middle ground. The momentum will be set to 0.88, which is in line with peer history. The optimizer chosen is 'Adam', as it tends to work well across different tasks and is generally robust, especially with low-quality data. The batch size will be set to 8 to accommodate the low-resource nature of the client. A dropout rate of 0.2 is reasonable to help combat overfitting while still allowing the network to learn effectively. For local epochs, I\u2019ll choose 2 to balance learning and stability. For the server parameters, I will select a learning rate of 0.001, which is common for the server role, along with momentum of 0.9 and 'Adam' optimizer for its adaptive learning rate capabilities. The scheduler will be set to 'None' to start with the basics.

Since the test accuracy is relatively decent, there is no need to increase the learning rate significantly, which could lead to instability. Instead, I will opt for a lower learning rate of 0.0005 to ensure a stable training process, especially given the low-resource nature of the client. Additionally, I will keep the batch_size at 8, as it's already been established that this size works for the client. Given the previous successful setup and the recommendations about controlling overfitting and ensuring stable training for low-resource clients, I suggest keeping the weight_decay at the same value of 0.0005 to help with regularization. The momentum will remain at 0.88 to maintain a balance between stability and convergence speed. The optimizer will remain as 'Adam', which has been effective historically. The dropout_rate will be increased to 0.3 to counteract any signs of overfitting while still adhering to the constraints. The server-side hyperparameters will be kept consistent at learning_rate = 0.001, momentum = 0.9, and optimizer = 'Adam', with the scheduler set to 'None'. Finally, I will confirm mu at 0.05, which has reportedly worked in previous iterations. This combination of hyperparameters aims to fine-tune the model's performance optimally without risking overfitting or underfitting."

A dropout rate of 0.2 is chosen to add a layer of regularization while still allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server, I have also set the learning rate to 0.001 to maintain consistency across training. The momentum remains at 0.9, and the optimizer is likewise set to 'Adam' to simplify implementation and ensure successful aggregation of learning across clients.

Since the client has previously employed a learning rate of 0.001 which is consistent with the allowed range, and considering the moderate resource capabilities, I have decided to decrease the learning rate slightly to enhance training stability while remaining in the optimal range. The weight decay was set at 0.0001 previously, which is on the lower end of the allowed range. I am opting for a slightly higher value of 0.0005 to counteract potential overfitting without being overly restrictive, as the test accuracy was reasonable but not optimal. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 to maintain a balance between convergence efficiency and oscillation control. The optimizer remains as AdamW, which is a good choice for the problem at hand. The learning rate scheduler will be set to None to allow for a stable training environment without cycling the learning rate. I will set local_epochs to 2, allowing for enough passes over the dataset without straining the client\u2019s capacity. A batch size of 24 will be used to optimize memory usage while training. Finally, I will slightly increase the dropout rate to 0.3, given the moderately high training accuracy compared to the test accuracy, to mitigate any potential overfitting. For the server, I recommend a learning rate of 0.001, which has been effective thus far and is within the valid range. The server's momentum will also remain consistent at 0.9 with AdamW as the optimizer and StepLR as the learning rate schedule to allow for future adaptations. The mu value is set at 0.05, providing regularization strength without being too restrictive on the local updates.",

Weight decay is set to 1e-04 to provide some regularization without overly constraining the model's ability to fit the training data. A momentum of 0.9 is chosen since it is a standard choice that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction while dampening oscillations. The AdamW optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which can be beneficial in complex loss landscapes, like those typical in image classification tasks. For the scheduler, 'CosineAnnealingLR' is selected, as it can optimize learning rate decay effectively during training. Given this is a moderate resource client, local_epochs is set to 2 to allow sufficient training without overwhelming the client's capacity. A batch size of 32 is chosen, which balances the optimization speed and memory constraints well. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is included to help mitigate overfitting, which is particularly important in image classification where models can learn intricate patterns too closely tied to the training data. For the server, the values reflect the client's: the learning rate remains at 0.001 to coordinate with client dynamics, and similar choices for momentum and optimizer to maintain consistency.

Since the test accuracy was not significantly far from the expected performance level, this indicates that the model may not be suffering from severe underfitting or overfitting. Therefore, I will suggest adjustments that could help refine the model's performance without risking instability. The current `learning_rate` of 0.001 is optimal, as it falls within the suggested range for image classification tasks; keeping it at this setting avoids introducing potential instability through a higher value. The `weight_decay` will be adjusted to 0.0005 to enforce stronger regularization, as it will help mitigate any risks of overfitting while still retaining performance. The `momentum` will be maintained at 0.9 because it has functioned well historically. I will suggest `local_epochs` of 3 to enhance the convergence of the model. The `batch_size` of 32 is appropriate for medium-resource clients like this one. The `dropout_rate` will be increased to 0.3 to further prevent overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively from the data. On the server side, I will select a `learning_rate` of 0.001, which maintains consistency with the client-level settings, and an `optimizer` of 'AdamW' to benefit from adaptive learning rates based on the gradient. A `scheduler` of 'CosineAnnealingLR' will be employed for gradual decay of the learning rate during training.

Therefore, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.4 to help with regularization, while maintaining the initial learning rate (0.001) as it falls within the suggested range. The weight decay will also be slightly increased to 0.0005 to introduce more regularization and reduce overfitting. Given the client's high-resource capabilities, I will set the batch size to 128, allowing for more efficient training. I will keep the local epochs at 2, as it balances between training time and convergence rates. On the server side, I will use the same learning rate and optimizer as the client to maintain consistency, choosing the scheduler as 'None' to avoid complications from dynamic learning rate adjustments.

Given that we are considering improving upon this result and operating in a high-resource environment, we can afford to be slightly more aggressive with the hyperparameters. We will select a learning rate slightly higher than the previous one to potentially improve training dynamics while remaining within the specified constraints. Setting the learning rate to 0.0005 is supported by the guidance that a higher learning rate can help when both test and train accuracies are low. We will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' for its effective performance in most image classification tasks. The momentum will remain at 0.9, aligning with the client\u2019s history, as there is no evidence against its effectiveness. We will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 to help mitigate any potential overfitting, as we want to ensure our model generalizes better to new data. The batch_size is set to 64, which is consistent with the previous run and is manageable within the client\u2019s high-resource parameters. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is chosen to further regularize the network, responding to the potential risk of overfitting due to the complexity of the ResNet18 architecture. For server parameters, we'll match the client's optimizer and momentum values with 'AdamW' and 0.9. For the learning rate, we will set it slightly lower than the client's to ensure stable global training dynamics, at 0.0003, remaining well within the allowed range. For the scheduler, we will opt for 'None' to keep the process straightforward and consistent with the client's past use.

The `momentum` remains at 0.9 consistent with prior configurations for stability.

The batch size of 8 is optimal for the client's resource limits, allowing for stable training without excessive memory usage.

The analysis indicates a need to lower the learning rate, as it aligns with the historical performance and maintains the stability essential for a low-resource client. A learning rate of 0.0003 is the highest permissible value under the constraints while still promoting stability and reducing risks of instability associated with larger values. Additionally, maintaining a lower `weight_decay` of 1e-05 helps regularize performance. The continued use of SGD optimizer suits the client's performance in past trials, and keeping the momentum at 0.9 aligns with effective practices for momentum in SGD. For batch size, I will keep it at 16, as it is acceptable within constraints while still manageable for low-resource clients. I will also retain the dropout rate at 0.2, helping mitigate overfitting without over-complicating the architecture. On the server side, I will use a learning rate of 0.001, which is optimal and is consistent with the previous server settings. The momentum of 0.9 provides good inertia, and the use of SGD optimizer is consistent, ensuring coherence between client and server operations. The same scheduler (\u2018None\u2019) is used to avoid potential conflicts or adjustments that may not be beneficial to this specific setting. Finally, I will set `mu` to 0.01 since it lies within the defined range and remains consistent with the trials of peers, offering stability to learning across federated settings."

I will slightly decrease the `learning_rate` to 0.0005 to allow more gradual convergence while staying within the defined constraints. The `weight_decay` can be set to 0.0005 for some regularization to counteract possible overfitting considering the medium resource allocation, improved from the previous value of 0.0001. The `momentum` will remain at 0.9, which has been working well, while `optimizer` will stay as 'AdamW' for continued effectiveness. The `local_epochs` will stay at 2, allowing sufficient training without overextending resource use, and the `batch_size` remains at 32 for consistent processing. The `dropout_rate` will be adjusted to 0.3, a slight increase balanced between the extremes, assisting in generalization without drastically impacting learning capability. For the server parameters, the `learning_rate` will be set at 0.001, to keep a strong and stable learning throughout the federated context.

The weight decay is set to 0.0001 to provide a slight regularization effect without being too heavy, which is appropriate in the absence of any historical data suggesting strong overfitting or underfitting. The momentum is set at 0.9, which is a standard value that usually works well across various models. I opted for the 'AdamW' optimizer, which is commonly effective for CNNs and helps mitigate issues with convergence. The local_epochs is set to 2, balancing enough training iterations within limited resources. The batch size is chosen to be 64, which fits well with medium resource constraints. For dropout_rate, a moderate value of 0.2 is chosen to help prevent potential overfitting without excessive regularization. For server parameters, the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 are retained for consistency, while using the 'AdamW' optimizer as well. There is no explicit need for adaptation on the server-side at this stage, so the scheduler is set to 'None'.

Since there\u2019s no indication of significant overfitting from the accuracy figures, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001, which is conservative and effective based on the past results. This should allow for a balanced learning pace. For weight decay, I will increase it to 0.0005 to add some regularization while staying below the maximum limit, which can help the model generalize better without compromising performance. The momentum will stay at 0.9, which has historically worked well. I will switch the optimizer to 'SGD' since it can provide better convergence than AdamW in some scenarios, especially in bigger models like ResNet, and a cosine annealing scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR) can additionally enhance learning rates over epochs. I'll maintain the local epochs at 2 to strike a balance without overfitting on the client side. Given that this is a high-resource client, I will opt for a higher batch size of 128 to make better use of the available resources. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate from 0.2 to 0.3 to further mitigate overfitting while ensuring we do not negatively impact the actual learning. On the server-side, the `learning_rate` will remain at 0.001 to maintain consistency given the client's effective use previously, using 'SGD' as well for consistency with the client side.

The learning rate of 0.001 is at the edge of the higher end of the constraints. In image classification, a lower learning rate can often help with convergence issues if we're close to optimal but not quite there. Hence, I will suggest a lower learning rate of 0.0001, as it might aid fine-tuning and prevent overshooting the minima during training. The weight decay will be set at 0.0005 to provide stronger regularization against overfitting, especially since the training and test accuracies are not drastically different. Keeping momentum at 0.9 aligns with current practices that have shown positive results in the client's history and peer performance. The optimizer choice will remain 'AdamW' as it\u2019s effective and aligns with the previous configuration. I will suggest 'None' for the scheduler as it's been used effectively in the client's previous rounds without introducing unnecessary complexity. The local epochs remain at 2, providing a good balance between computation time and model training. The batch size will be reduced to 32 to accommodate the moderate cluster resource since lower resource clients can sometimes struggle with higher batches. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting risks in the training process, especially given the moderate capacity of the client. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client settings except for the learning rate, which will increase to 0.001 for robustness across clients, and the optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' with a scheduler set to 'None' for the same reasons."

Given that the client is in a high-resource cluster, this allows for the use of a moderately higher learning rate. I will set the `learning_rate` to 0.001, which is a good starting point that balances exploration without being excessively aggressive. For `weight_decay`, I will use 0.0001 to provide light regularization while still allowing the model to learn effectively. A `momentum` value of 0.9 is standard and helps accelerate SGD momentum updates, improving convergence. I will choose the `AdamW` optimizer because it is effective for image tasks, especially on datasets like CIFAR-10. The learning strategy will utilize `CosineAnnealingLR`, which helps adjust the learning rate over iterations, making it suitable for optimizing training over several epochs. For `local_epochs`, I will set this to 2 to allow sufficient training time without risking overfitting, and `batch_size` will be set to 64, which is a manageable size given the cluster's capacity. Lastly, I will set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to help mitigate any early overfitting since we will be training on CIFAR-10. In terms of server parameters, to align with the client setup, I will use a similar `learning_rate` of 0.001 and `momentum` of 0.9, along with the `Adam` optimizer and a `None` scheduler as the server does not require a dynamic learning rate adjustment at this stage. The global parameter `mu` will be set to 0.01 to allow for some regularization in the federated learning scheme, providing a balance between client updates and server stability.",

Since the client is in a low-resource cluster with a smaller `batch_size`, lowering `weight_decay` will help ensure stability during training. I will select `momentum` towards the middle of the allowed range to balance between stagnation and oscillations during optimization. I'm also maintaining the `optimizer` as 'AdamW' for its adaptive learning properties, which should help with the image classification task. The `dropout_rate` will remain low (0.2), as the current test accuracy doesn't strongly suggest overfitting issues. For the server-side, I will stick with a `learning_rate` of 0.001 as it\u2019s an appropriate value for stability and can function well with the rest of the settings. I will use the same optimizer 'AdamW' for consistency and ensure there\u2019s no scheduling changes on the server side.

However, since our constraints limit the client learning rate to a maximum of 0.0005, I will adjust it to this maximum. A higher learning rate might help in this case as the training accuracy could suggest that the model is underfitting based on the historical test performance. Additionally, to prevent issues typical for low-resource clients, I've kept the batch size at 16 as it is the maximum they can handle while still being manageable. The weight decay is kept at 0.0001, which is the same as the previous run, to maintain regularization effects without making it too aggressive. Given the underfitting evidence from the client's history, I am suggesting a higher dropout rate of 0.3, which also aligns with helping mitigate overfitting while still being conservative. The use of 'AdamW' as the optimizer will remain consistent as it aligns with keeping stability under low resources. For the server parameters, I will also set the learning rate to 0.0005 to match the maximum allowable value in the context of adjusting for the client\u2019s performance. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' because it effectively stabilizes training in a federated setting. Lastly, I will select a 'None' scheduler to keep the server's training straightforward, given that a more complex scheduling might not be beneficial right now.

The chosen optimizer is `AdamW` due to its effectiveness in handling overfitting, which is crucial when working with models like ResNet on datasets such as CIFAR-10. I will set the `learning_rate` to 0.001, a common starting point that allows for gradual learning without overshooting minima. The `weight_decay` will be set at 1e-04 to introduce a regularization effect without being too aggressive, as it can help in mitigating overfitting. The `momentum` is set to 0.9, which is a widely accepted value that assists in accelerating SGD in the direction of minima. For the `scheduler`, I will opt for `CosineAnnealingLR`, which often helps models converge more smoothly. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 to provide a good number of updates without overwhelming the client's resources. Finally, the `dropout_rate` will be set to 0.2, providing a moderate approach to reducing overfitting while allowing for sufficient learning capacity.

The previous experiment with a learning rate of 0.0005 yielded a test accuracy of 70.63%, so lowering it slightly could help avoid potential overfitting, especially since the learning rate needs to be lower for efficient training in low-resource environments. The weight decay is set to 0.0005, as it helped improve generalization while staying within the specified range. The momentum is maintained at 0.9, consistent with successful runs in previous epochs. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as per past performance. I decided to increase the dropout rate to 0.4 from 0.3 to combat any signs of overfitting. The batch size is kept at 16, which is optimum according to history. The local epochs are capped at 2 to avoid overextending the training period given the client's resource limitations. For the server parameters, I retained a learning rate of 0.0003 to facilitate optimal global model updates without straying beyond the specified limits, and momentum and optimizer parameters mirror those used in the client's settings to ensure consistency.

The client's historical use of a learning rate of 0.0005 has yielded positive results, so maintaining this rate is prudent. However, considering the need for refinement, I'll decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.0004, which is still conducive to flexibility while ensuring adjustments can be made without causing drastic underfitting. The previous weight decay of 5e-05 has shown modest regularization; increasing it to 1e-04 should help curb any potential overfitting, especially as the drop in accuracy might suggest this is necessary. The momentum of 0.9 aligns well with the client's past settings, emphasizing stability during training. Using 'Adam' as an optimizer helps in adaptive learning and has been effective in previous runs. I will opt for a dropout rate of 0.25 to enhance generalization, falling between the past values of 0.2 and 0.3. The batch size is selected as 32, as per the available options, to ensure a good trade-off between performance and resource constraints. On the server side, retaining the existing configurations seems appropriate, maintaining effective communication during training, and ensuring model updates remain regular without over-complication. Finally, keeping mu at 0.01 offers further reinforcement for client updates without causing instability in training.",

Therefore, I will set the learning_rate to 0.002, which remains conservative yet effective for a high-resource client. The weight_decay will be adjusted to 0.0005 to help regularize the model without overly penalizing the weights. The momentum will be maintained at 0.9, as it is a generally effective value that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The optimizer will remain as 'Adam', which works well with ResNet architectures. I will increase the batch_size to 128, allowing more extended updates per epoch while still being manageable. The dropout_rate will be set to 0.3, the same as before, to help prevent overfitting without overly restricting the model's capacity. I've also decided to set local_epochs to 2, which balances training time and effectiveness. For the server parameters, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.001 to maintain stability across federated rounds. Momentum will also remain at 0.9 for the same reasons as for the client. The optimizer will be 'Adam', consistent with the client's choice. Lastly, I\u2019ll set the scheduler to 'None' to avoid unnecessary complexity without any indicated performance benefits.

Therefore, I suggest increasing it to 0.00075 to further regularize the model. The batch size of 24 is not permitted under the constraints, so I will select the next available size of 16. The dropout rate was set to 0.4 previously, which seems appropriate to manage overfitting, but I will maintain it as is due to no signs of underfitting. For the server settings, I recommend keeping the learning rate at 0.001, which is a commonly successful setting, along with the same optimizer and scheduler used previously, as they are performing well. The mu value remains at 0.01, which aligns with previous iterations and peer examples."

The training accuracy is not specified, but since we are aiming for improvement, examining the current `weight_decay` and `learning_rate` is essential. The learning_rate of 0.001 was used previously, which is a reasonable starting point, but we could consider a higher value if both training and test accuracies are low. Given the high resource capability of the client, we can afford to adjust the `weight_decay` slightly to help combat any potential overfitting - thus, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 0.0005. Using the `AdamW` optimizer previously allowed the client to attain a good performance, and I will continue with that. The `momentum` will be kept at 0.9 for stability, while the `local_epochs` will remain at 2 as it provides a good balance between training duration and convergence. I will use a `batch_size` of 128 this time to exploit the high resource capacity of the client and possibly accelerate training. A `dropout_rate` of 0.3 is suggested as it is on the higher side to help with regularization given the potential for overfitting. For the server parameters, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.001 for consistency with the client and stability, while momentum and optimizer settings will remain the same to ensure uniformity in updates across clients.

The use of AdamW is maintained as it has been beneficial in previous trials. To combat potential overfitting seen in training-test discrepancies, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005.

Additionally, looking at the peer history where a `dropout_rate` of 0.4 achieved better results, I propose increasing the `dropout_rate` slightly to 0.4 to help mitigate potential overfitting without exceeding the maximum. The `weight_decay` is already at 0.0007, which is reasonable for regularization, so I will keep it the same. The momentum will be maintained at 0.9 as this has shown to be effective. The batch size remains 16, which is within constraints, but the `local_epochs` will remain at 2 for stability. For the server, I will suggest a slight increase in `learning_rate` to 0.001, as the current setup can handle a more aggressive learning strategy given the size of the dataset and expected convergence behavior. The server momentum will stay at 0.9 and the optimizer remains as Adam, consistent with successful configurations. The `scheduler` can remain as 'None' to keep it simple for the low-resource clients.

Therefore, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0004 to encourage more stable training. Additionally, weight decay has been set to 0.0008; given the trend in increasing performance, we want to ensure regularization while being cautious, so I will suggest leaving it slightly higher at 0.0007. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, consistent with previous successful trials. The usage of 'AdamW' will remain the same, as the optimizer has worked well. For batch size, 16 is maintainable for low-resource clients, and I will leave the local epochs consistent at 2 to ensure stable training without overloading resources. The dropout rate has previously been effective at 0.4, balancing underfitting and overfitting concerns. The server parameters should stay the same as they have proven to be effective. Therefore, I suggest keeping the server learning rate at 0.001, momentum at 0.9, and using 'Adam' as the optimizer with no schedule adjustment, confirming consistent results.

The weight decay will be set to 0.0007, which is within optimal bounds for regularization, helping to prevent any potential overfitting. I will utilize the 'Adam' optimizer as it generally performs well on image classification tasks, and it fits the client\u2019s resource constraints. For the momentum, I will use 0.9 to maintain consistency with what has proven effective in peer results. The batch size will be set to 16 since smaller batches are favorable for low-resource clients and align with peer usage. A local_epochs value of 2 will allow sufficient training while limiting resource demands. Lastly, the dropout rate is set to 0.4 based on peer insights indicating it aids in reducing overfitting recently observed in these tasks. For server parameters, I will mirror the learning rate of 0.001 from peer capabilities, using 'Adam' as the optimizer for consistency. Finally, I will set mu to 0.01, aligned with the peer strategy for controlled regularization in the Federated Learning setup.",

The weight decay will be increased to 0.0008 to promote regularization and combat potential overfitting, as high training accuracy but comparatively lower test accuracy can be indicative of such issues. The momentum will be maintained at 0.9 as it currently suits both the optimizer and the training dynamics. The chosen optimizer will remain 'AdamW' as it effectively addresses issues of weight decay inherent in the architecture. Local epochs will remain at 2, and the batch size will remain at 64 to manage memory usage while still offering sufficient data per update. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.35 to further aid in mitigating overfitting. On the server side, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 allows for stability in global model updates, while ensuring momentum stays at 0.9 supports the adaptive optimization strategy. The same optimizer 'AdamW' will be employed at the server level to maintain consistency in the optimization approach.

A learning rate of 0.0002 should be a conservative choice that allows for gradual convergence. The weight decay will be adjusted to 1e-04 to provide some regularization, helping to prevent overfitting. The momentum will be kept at 0.9 as it was successful in the past. Using the Adam optimizer aligns with the client's previous setup, and I'll set the scheduler to 'None' as it was not used previously and is appropriate for now. For the local epochs, I will keep it at 2, which is reasonable for the expected performance. The batch size will be set to 16 as used previously. Finally, I will slightly increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to help with regularization and adapt to the client\u2019s low-resource nature, avoiding potential overfitting given the higher dropout in peer history (0.4).

This should balance exploration of the learning landscape without risking instabilities. The choice of 'Adam' as the optimizer is supported by peer performance and is widely used for image classification models. A momentum of 0.9 has been effective for peers and should ensure smooth convergence. Based on the moderate capacity of Cluster 1, a batch_size of 16 is appropriate, allowing the client to perform adequately without overloading resources. I will set local_epochs to 2 to provide a good balance between model training and resource constraint. A weight_decay of 0.0005 is appropriate for regularization while helping to mitigate potential overfitting. Additionally, a dropout_rate of 0.2 allows for reducing overfitting risks effectively while maintaining model capacity. For the server parameters, I will align the learning_rate (0.001) and momentum (0.9) with the client's choices to ensure consistent server-client communication.

The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0005, consistent with prior settings, which aids regularization without penalizing performance too much. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to ensure effective learning dynamics based on previous experiments. The optimizer will be chosen as 'Adam', a solid option for image classification tasks like this. The scheduler remains as 'StepLR' for effectively managing learning rate decay over epochs. We will stick to 2 local epochs and a `batch_size` of 16, both of which are moderate and previously successful. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3 to mitigate the potential for overfitting, given the close accuracy rates in prior attempts. For the server-side parameters, we will match the 'learning_rate' at 0.001 as it is on the higher side of the allowed range, while still being manageable. Using the same momentum of 0.9 seems consistent across both client and peer histories. An optimizer of 'Adam' is also chosen for server-side operations with 'StepLR' for consistent learning rate management.

In this context, I will optimize the hyperparameters for better generalization.

However, I will also increase the weight_decay to 0.001 to mitigate overfitting and improve regularization, as higher weight decay can help balance the training and testing performance. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it's been functional in the past, and the optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' due to its effectiveness in the previous runs. Batch size will remain 64 to maintain consistency, as this was already handled well by the client. I will slightly adjust the dropout_rate to 0.4 to further combat potential overfitting. The server parameters will mirror these changes, with a learning rate of 0.001 to maintain stable training across clients and ensure compatibility without being too aggressive.

The batch size can be set to 256 as the client has high resources allowing handling a larger batch size, which improves stability in training. I will maintain the dropout rate at 0.2 as there is no indication of overfitting from previous results, and an increase may hinder performance. The server parameters will match the client's learning rate for consistency during training, with momentum set at 0.9, which is a strong choice for stability.

Since the client's capacity is low-resource, I'll opt for a smaller `learning_rate` to ensure stable training. I'll set `learning_rate` to 0.0005 as this is a common value that balances between stability and speed of learning, which is aligned with the peer example (Client 97) who achieved reasonable accuracy. Given the same reasoning, I will also set `weight_decay` to 0.0001, which can help prevent overfitting in a model like ResNet18 that's being trained on CIFAR-10, especially for low-resource clients. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, maximizing convergence while staying within constraints. The chosen optimizer will be 'AdamW' for its good performance on image classification tasks. For `local_epochs`, 2 is a balanced value allowing sufficient training without overburdening the resource-constrained environment. The `batch_size` will be 16 as it fits within the low-resource capacity and aligns with the peer's performance. Finally, I will set `dropout_rate` to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting while still allowing enough capacity to learn the underlying data patterns. For the server parameters, I'll mirror the client's learning rate and choose 'AdamW' as the optimizer, as it worked well for a peer. I will set the server's `momentum` also to 0.9 to keep training dynamics consistent. Lastly, 'None' for the scheduler will be appropriate to avoid extra complexity in this initial round. The regularization parameter `mu` is set to 0.01, a moderate choice based on the context to help stabilize training across federated learning setup.",

The weight decay is currently at 0.0001, which does not fit within the required range; thus, increasing it to 0.0002 will provide slightly better regularization without causing overfitting. The momentum remains optimal at 0.9, as suggested by prior configurations. The optimizer 'AdamW' has proven effective and remains the best choice. For the local_epochs, retaining a value of 2 is sensible, given stability needs. The batch size of 16 has already been established as a working configuration, maintaining the potential for stable training. Finally, for the dropout_rate, increasing it slightly to 0.4 may help with overfitting given that both train and test accuracies have been generally strong. For the server-side, keeping the learning rate at 0.001 ensures that the global model can still effectively combine weights from all clients. The momentum of 0.9 follows the current logic, and using the same optimizer 'AdamW' ensures consistency across client-server setups, while 'None' for the scheduler appears to simplify the setup appropriately.

The weight decay is increased to 0.0005 to enhance regularization, addressing potential overfitting issues. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain steady convergence.

Additionally, since the model seems to benefit from regularization, I will increase the weight decay to 0.0005, which is permissible, to counteract potential overfitting further. I'll keep the momentum at 0.9 to maintain stability in training and choose the 'Adam' optimizer, as it has shown effectiveness with image classification tasks. The dropout rate should be increased to 0.2 to prevent overfitting, given the moderate capacity of the client. The local epochs remain at 3 and batch size at 32, which allow sufficient learning under current resource constraints.

The weight decay has gradually increased, but it's currently at 0.0006; hence I will increase it slightly to 0.0007, which still stays within the allowed range, to combat potential overfitting. The dropout rate of 0.4 was previously applied without significant negative impact, so I will retain it, as it might contribute towards regularization. For server parameters, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0005, which was previously effective, alongside the same optimizer (AdamW) for consistency and stability across runs.

A `learning_rate` of 0.001 strikes a balance between conservativeness and aggression, allowing faster learning without risking divergence. A `weight_decay` of 1e-04 will help with regularization and combat potential overfitting, as image models can often suffer from this. For `momentum`, a value of 0.9 is a standard choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging. The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen because it generally performs well with image data and adapts the learning rate for each parameter dynamically, which is beneficial for the complexities often seen in image classification tasks. A `batch_size` of 64 leverages the client's high-capacity resources without overwhelming them. I will use a `dropout_rate` of 0.3, providing a balance to help prevent overfitting while still allowing for sufficient model capacity. As this is the first round and no scheduling need has been indicated, I suggest using 'None' for the scheduler. On the server side, I will keep the `learning_rate` at 0.001, using the same optimizer and momentum to maintain consistency, and also set the scheduler to 'None' for the same reason. The value for `mu` is set to 0.01, providing a moderate influence of the FedProx regularization, as we aim for stability initially due to the untested nature of this client.",

The client's previous learning rate of 0.001 is reasonable but can be adjusted to see if a slightly higher value, 0.002, can help capture more complexity. The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0001 to help combat overfitting issues. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, as it has traditionally assisted in maintaining model stability during training. The chosen optimizer remains 'AdamW' due to its previous effectiveness. The scheduler stays as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually adjust learning rates over epochs. A batch size of 128 is selected to balance the capacity of the client and to stay within typical ranges. I suggest raising the dropout_rate slightly to 0.3 to better manage overfitting while using an effective dropout strength. The server parameters will mirror the client in terms of learning rate and optimizer but will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 to provide a more stable global approach.

The selected weight decay of 0.0005 will help regulate potential overfitting without overly restricting learning capacity. I will use momentum of 0.9, as it's common for stabilizing training. AdamW is chosen as the optimizer since it frequently performs well with image data and is the same as the peer's. The batch size is set to 16, striking a balance between resource constraints and sufficient gradient variability. I will suggest 2 local epochs, as it allows for reasonable weight updates without overwhelming the client's resources. The dropout rate is set at 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting due to the potentially complex nature of the ResNet architecture. For the server, I selected the same learning rate, optimizer, and momentum for consistency. The scheduler is set to 'None' for simplicity at this early stage, minimizing the risk of complications.

Given the constraints, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0003, which is still on the upper edge but aligns with stability for low-resource clients. The recommended weight decay will be set to 0.0001, which will help with regularization. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it's working effectively, and I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' because it's historically yielded better results for image classification tasks. The local epochs will remain at 2, maintaining stable updates, and the batch size will remain at 16 due to resource constraints. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.5 to combat overfitting based on the previous patterns of overfitting risks.

The local_epochs will stay at 2, considering stability in training time, and the batch_size will be set to 16 as the client history supports its use. Lastly, I will keep the dropout_rate at 0.4, as it has proven beneficial in the past, suggesting it helps mitigate overfitting. On the server-side, I'll match the learning_rate to 0.0003 to ensure symmetry and maintain effective communication protocols. The momentum will remain at 0.9 for consistency. The optimizer will again be 'AdamW', and the scheduler will be set to 'None' as no scheduling has been utilized so far, which seems to be working effectively.

The learning rate of 0.001 is towards the higher end of the constraints for the client, and since both training and test accuracies are relatively aligned, I will reduce it slightly to 0.0005 to stabilize training without risking underfitting. I will keep the optimizer as SGD, which is consistent with the client's history. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 for additional regularization since CIFAR-10 is a relatively complex dataset and regularization could help improve test accuracy. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 should be beneficial for the optimization process, so I will not change it. The local epochs remain at 2.0, balancing between effective training and avoiding excessive computation for a medium-resource client. I will also keep the batch size at 32 and dropout at 0.2 based on the previous settings which provided a balanced performance. For the server settings, a learning rate of 0.001 keeps the server's training stable and aligns with the client's tuning, so I will retain it. Momentum will remain at 0.9, and the optimizer spreads risks while maintaining efficiency, so SGD is selected here. I will not use a scheduler, keeping it 'None' as it was configured earlier.

The momentum of 0.9 is consistent to maintain training stability. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW', which should provide good convergence.

The guidance suggests that the learning rate and optimizer choice are critical. In medium-resource environments, we should aim for reasonable defaults to prevent underfitting and overfitting. I will choose a moderately low learning rate of 0.001 to mitigate potential overfitting while giving the model thorough training. For the optimizer, AdamW offers better performance with image data compared to SGD, particularly for its ability to adaptively adjust learning rates. A weight decay of 0.0001 will be implemented for light regularization, while a momentum of 0.9 will help accelerate gradients across the optimization landscape. A batch size of 32 is a balanced option for medium-resource clients, allowing efficient data processing without overloading their capacity. For dropout, I will set it to 0.2 to help prevent overfitting without being too aggressive. Local epochs will be set to 2 as a compromise between achieving a robust model and not overburdening resources without historical context. For the server, I will align the learning rate and optimizer with the client's settings to maintain consistency. A moderate `mu` of 0.05 is chosen for normal federated optimization control as it falls comfortably within the permissible range.

The weight decay remains at 0.0001, as it hasn't negatively influenced past results. Additionally, I will recommend a dropout rate of 0.15 to balance regularization without too much restriction on feature learning, as the current value is low. The client is on a high-resource cluster, allowing for a slightly higher batch size which can stabilize learning further. For the server side, I will maintain the learning rate and optimizer as 'AdamW' to ensure consistency across training, while the scheduler can be 'None' since it has been working well without scheduling changes. The mu value is set to 0.01 to maintain a consistent federated learning penalty without imposing excess regularization.",

The peer's performance indicates that lowering the learning rate has been beneficial for others without degrading accuracy. The `weight_decay` will be increased to 0.0005 to help with regularization and to combat any overfitting concerns based on the client's high test accuracy and the previous high accuracy of the peer's model. A moderate dropout rate of 0.3 is suggested to improve generalization. For `momentum`, I will keep it at 0.9 as it remained constant and compliant with the peer's performance. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' due to its effectiveness in dealing with image classification tasks, and the `local_epochs` will be set at 2, aligning with successful previous settings.

The weight decay is set to 1e-06 to maintain regularization while avoiding drastic penalties that might worsen learning stability. I will choose momentum of 0.9, as it is effective in stabilizing training dynamics and is also seen in the peer client. The optimizer 'AdamW' is chosen because it is adaptive and more suitable for clients with limited resources. The batch size is set to 8 to further reduce memory load, in line with low-resource environment practices. I also keep local_epochs to a modest 2 to balance between training time and model convergence while using a dropout_rate of 0.2 based on peer strategies which may help prevent overfitting. For the server, maintaining a similar approach with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 will provide a good base for the federated setup, while using 'AdamW' for optimizing server-side updates.

Notably, their settings resulted in a 51.64% accuracy. To start, I will adopt a conservative approach due to the low-resource constraints of this client. Given the guidance suggesting that low-resource clients may require smaller batch sizes or lower learning rates, I will set the 'learning_rate' to 0.0005 (a moderate choice, linked to general peer performance) and 'batch_size' to the smallest option of 8. The 'weight_decay' will be set at 1e-06 to minimize overfitting risk while maintaining some regularization. The 'momentum' will be set to 0.9, in line with common practices that help in stabilizing the training process. The optimizer will be 'AdamW', which is known to work well in scenarios involving image classification tasks, particularly with small datasets like CIFAR-10. No learning rate scheduler is defined for the client-side as it appears peer clients did not use them effectively. For 'local_epochs', I've chosen 2 as a moderate number (between 1 and 3) to ensure stability without overburdening the client. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is selected to help mitigate potential overfitting. For the server-side, I will mirror the 'optimizer' and 'momentum' values from the peer (Client 289), and set the 'learning_rate' at 0.001, which aligns with the performance trends seen. Finally, I will set 'mu' to 0.01 as it is a reasonable starting point for FedProx regularization, falling within the constraint range.",

The client's learning_rate was already at the maximum threshold (0.0005) within the constraint range and had a weight_decay of 1e-06. The reported accuracy suggests there may be some issues with overfitting since the learning rate is higher. Therefore, I'll adjust the weight_decay to 1e-05 which is at the upper limit to add more regularization. This should help combat any overfitting while the learning_rate remains stable at 0.0005. The batch_size of 8 is suitable considering the low-resource client capacity, ensuring stable training. I also suggest maintaining the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has worked well previously. For dropout_rate, I will increase it to 0.3, which is within the limits, to further mitigate overfitting. The local_epochs will remain at 2 for balanced updates without overwhelming the low-resource client at this stage. For the server hyperparameters, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is conservative yet effective for server-side updates. 'AdamW' is a solid choice for the optimizer here as well considering its versatility. Finally, I will keep mu at 0.01, which has been used successfully in the past without any observed detrimental effects."

Therefore, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0005 for better stability. The weight decay previously set at 0.0001 is suitable, helping to regularize the model without causing underfitting. The momentum can be maintained at 0.9, which is a common effective choice. The choice of optimizer will be kept as 'Adam' since it was previously used successfully. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' has been effective, so I will retain this as well. I will increase the local epochs slightly to 3 to allow the model to learn more from the data. The batch size will be adjusted to 48, adhering to the provided options. The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.2, as a balance between regularization and model capacity is vital. For the server side, I will suggest the same learning rate and momentum as the client because consistency is beneficial for federated learning, and having a lower learning rate aligns with the need to prevent overfitting. I will set 'Adam' as the server optimizer as well, ensuring uniformity. The scheduler will remain as 'None' since that permits more straightforward implementation during the aggregation phase.

The test accuracy is not significantly higher than previous rounds, suggesting that fine-tuning the hyperparameters may yield better performance. Given that the learning rate has been decreased to 0.0005 and has tested successfully, we will use the lowest constraint of 0.0001 to potentially enhance learning without overshooting optimal points. The weight decay will be increased to 0.001 to further combat potential overfitting observed when high test accuracy is maintained with varying training parameters. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to ensure consistent convergence. I am opting for the SGD optimizer as it has been in use and is familiar to the client. A 'StepLR' scheduler is appropriate given the past use without conflict. I will also keep the local_epochs at 2 for balance, and select 'batch_size' of 32, which has been utilized previously. The dropout rate is increased to 0.4 to regularize further since the model is on the verge of high performance. For the server parameters, I am setting the learning_rate at 0.001 and maintaining 'StepLR' as it has been previously effective, ensuring consistency.

The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to further prevent overfitting, as the current settings might not be providing adequate regularization given the relatively high training accuracy. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 as it has been effective in the past. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as it's a strong choice for this type of model, and the scheduler will stay as 'CosineAnnealingLR' due to its ability to adjust learning rates dynamically. Given the client's capabilities, I will use a batch size of 128 for efficiency and suggest using a dropout rate of 0.3 to enhance generalization by reducing overfitting risks. For the server parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 to ensure good convergence, momentum at 0.9, and retain the 'AdamW' optimizer with no scheduler for simplicity and stability.

Since both the client's and peer's configurations used the same learning rate (0.001) and weight decay (0.0001), it may be advantageous to slightly increase the learning rate within the bounds provided while still ensuring stability and minimizing the risk of overfitting. Therefore, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005 for the client side, which is the upper limit, to see if this can lead to improved convergence.

The learning rate will remain at 0.001, as increasing it further might lead to instability, and I will keep the weight decay the same (0.0001) since there is no evidence of overfitting, just the improvements. The batch size can be kept at 128 to leverage the high-resource capabilities of the client. The learning rate for the server will also remain at 0.001 to ensure it stays within the tuning strategy already established, and I will continue using SGD for optimization.

To potentially enhance the performance, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.0008, which is closer to the lower boundary and might help in fine-tuning the model. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to provide additional regularization against overfitting, while maintaining sufficient flexibility for learning. The momentum is kept at 0.9, as it\u2019s known to work well in such configurations. The optimizer will remain 'SGD', which has worked well for both the client and peers, with the cosine annealing scheduler to adjust the learning rate dynamically, enhancing training stability. The dropout rate will be adjusted to 0.3 to potentially prevent overfitting and improve generalization on the cifar10 dataset. The batch size of 128 is retained because it has been established as performant without compromising the high-resource capabilities. For server-side parameters, I am proposing a learning rate of 0.001 and retaining the same optimizer and momentum values for consistency with successful peer configurations. Finally, the mu parameter will be set to 0.01, consistent with prior usage. Overall, these adjustments aim to enhance the model's performance based on previous results and expert guidance.",

For the local epochs, the value of 2 offers a balance between training duration and resource constraints. The batch size will remain at 16 to accommodate the low-resource environment. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3 to help prevent overfitting without significantly impacting the learning capacity. For the server parameters, a learning rate of 0.001 is appropriate as it is within the allowed range and allows effective communication with the clients.

Increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0005 could help mitigate any potential overfitting, as well; though the current value of weight decay seems reasonable, this increase aligns with the potential need for better generalization. For momentum, I will remain at 0.9 since it has been effective before. I will switch the optimizer to 'SGD', which can sometimes yield better performance in image classification tasks, particularly with lower resource clients. Maintaining a smaller batch size of 16 is appropriate given their low resources, along with 2 local epochs which provides a bit more training while still being manageable. Lastly, I will increase the `dropout_rate` to 0.3 to help with overfitting as suggested by the guidance. For the server, I will stick with a learning rate of 0.001 since it fits well within the allowed range and provides stable updates, and I will continue with the previously successful optimizer 'Adam' and a scheduler of 'None' for a straightforward approach.

To balance learning without drastically reducing performance, I choose a learning rate of 0.0003, which is moderately higher than the last epoch to avoid underfitting. The weight decay is set to 0.0005 to introduce regularization without being too aggressive, as the previous setting of 0.001 had demonstrated slightly lower performance. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as that has been effective in earlier attempts. The optimizer remains 'SGD' given its previous success and simplicity. The learning scheduler is kept as 'StepLR', which has been consistent with prior tests. I am also increasing local_epochs to 3.0 and keeping the batch size at 32 to leverage the client\u2019s medium resources effectively. The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.4, which helped manage overfitting in previous epochs, ensuring good generalization. On the server side, I suggest keeping the learning rate at 0.001 to maintain stability in training, and the momentum stays at 0.9, along with the 'SGD' optimizer, as they have proven reliable.

Since both accuracy measures were not drastically far apart, this suggests the model might be slightly underfitting or is not optimized as efficiently as peer models. Therefore, a small increase in the `learning_rate` is appropriate, given the high-resource capability of the client. I will set the `learning_rate` to 0.0005, the upper limit of the allowed range. The previous weight_decay was 0.0005; maintaining it will ensure that we do not induce overfitting while enabling slightly aggressive learning. It\u2019s worth noting that peer dropout_rate was higher (0.4) and yielded better results, indicating potential for improvement. Therefore, I will increase the `dropout_rate` to 0.4. The parameter for `local_epochs` can remain at 2, per precedent. As for the remaining parameters, I\u2019ll keep `optimizer` as 'AdamW' and `scheduler` as 'None' for consistency with past configurations that provide decent performance. On the server side, I will also maintain `learning_rate` at 0.001, only a little below client limits, with `momentum` set to 0.9 and `optimizer` as 'AdamW' to stay in line with effective configurations. Finally, I will select `mu` at a conservative but effective value of 0.01 to strike a balance in regularization. Overall, this configuration aligns with both the constraints and the observed potential for improvements.",

The learning rate of 0.00025 may not be aggressive enough to allow the model to learn effectively, as highlighted by the test accuracies around 78.56% and peer performance of 77.60%. Therefore, I suggest increasing the learning rate to 0.00015, which is still within the constraints. The weight decay of 0.00075 is valid but could be increased slightly to 0.0008 to improve regularization without overfitting, given that the client's highest accuracy (80.27%) suggests that we might need tighter constraints on the weights to improve generalization. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it stabilizes training effectively. The optimizer is still 'AdamW,' which has shown promise for this task. The scheduler will remain as 'StepLR' because it has helped previously but will limit changes that can lead to instability. I am maintaining a local_epochs value of 2 as this has been consistent, and it aligns with the previous setups without overwhelming the medium-resource capability of the client. For the batch_size, I'll set it to 16, as this balances well for the resource constraints. Lastly, I'll keep the dropout_rate at 0.4, which is on the higher end and should help with regularization given the performance dynamics observed. The server parameters will be derived similarly, with a learning rate of 0.001 based on prior efficacy, momentum retained at 0.9, and 'AdamW' used for consistency, while keeping 'StepLR' for the scheduler. The mu value remains at 0.01 because it has been stable in prior settings. Overall, these adjustments are aimed at enhancing test accuracy while adhering to resource constraints and previous performance trends."

I observe a potential for abundant computational resources on the client-side, so I will set the batch size to 128, which is consistent with their capabilities and Peer 223's choice. A weight decay of 0.0005 will help regularize the model without excessively penalizing weights, suitable for image classification tasks. Given that ResNet architectures can benefit from momentum for gradient updates, I will choose a momentum of 0.9, which is also aligned with Peer 223. An optimizer of 'AdamW' is a strong choice for image classification tasks due to its adaptive nature. A local epoch count of 2 is a balance between adequate training and efficiency. Finally, for the dropout rate, I will select 0.4, resonating with Peer 223's value, to help mitigate overfitting in this potent training environment. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client learning rate, momentum, and optimizer, ensuring consistency in training. The stopping criterion via scheduler is set to 'None' to avoid complicating the initial run.

The dropout rate stays at 0.4 to help manage overfitting, based on its past success. The overall setup should enhance model performance while adhering to all existing constraints.

The learning rates used (0.001 and 0.0005) yielded test accuracies of 78.38% and 77.83%, respectively. Since the test accuracy is still reasonably high, but not maximized, it suggests the potential for further tuning. Based on peers' successful tests, raising the `weight_decay` will help control overfitting, given a consistent `dropout_rate` effect seen in higher accuracy peers. Thus, I propose a `weight_decay` of 0.0005. The `batch_size` can be increased to 128, which is manageable for the high-resource client but must remain as per the available options. To explore learning dynamics more aggressively, a learning rate of 0.001 is advised as peers with this setting reached 80.13%. For dropout, I will go for 0.4 based on peer evidence suggesting that this higher dropout helped improve their model performance. For the server parameters, keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 aligns with existing guidelines. Thus, I will recommend a scheduler of 'None' for simplicity and continuous learning without decay.

The weight decay remains 1e-06, as increasing it may introduce more error in this case. Client 258 had a higher dropout rate (0.4) while achieving similar results (73.91%), indicating it might help regularize the model without overfitting strongly. Hence, I'll set the dropout rate to 0.4. The client has been using a local batch size of 16, which seems suitable, so I will maintain it. With local_epochs capped at 2, I will suggest keeping this value. For the server, I'll align the learning rate with the client to maintain coherence and retain the same optimizer (AdamW) and momentum (0.9), as they are performing well.

However, to align with strict constraints, I will lower the learning_rate to 0.0002 as it still remains within the range while providing a conservative update to prevent overfitting. The weight_decay will remain at 0.001, which has been beneficial for reducing overfitting indicated by the training and validation accuracies. The dropout_rate will be adjusted to 0.3, an increase over the previous setting, to further help reduce overfitting. The batch_size will be set to the allowed maximum of 48, as it provides a good trade-off between resource usage and performance. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW', as it has shown effective results in the past, and the local_epochs will stay at the maximum of 3 to allow sufficient training time. The server parameters are adjusted for the same reasons, keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 for consistent updates while limiting the risk of overfitting, and the scheduler remains 'None' to simplify the training while focusing on performance.

Since the test accuracy is not drastically lower than the training accuracy, I won't increase weight decay significantly but will set it to 0.0005 for mild regularization. The learning rate is on the higher end of the allowed range; however, I'll lower it slightly to 0.0003 to encourage more stable convergence. The momentum at 0.9 is effective and can be retained. The optimizer 'AdamW' is known for its performance in image tasks, so it will remain unchanged. The current dropout rate of 0.3 is acceptable, but increasing it to 0.35 may help with overfitting, and I can afford to adjust the local_epochs to 3 since the client has high resource capacity.

However, to stay within constraints, I'll set the learning rate to 0.0003. This value aims to balance exploration and stabilization in learning while adhering to guidelines for moderate-capacity clients. The previous batch size of 32 is reasonable and aligns with the client's medium-resource capacity, so I will keep it. Since the dropout rate of 0.4 showed improvement in preventing overfitting, I will maintain it as well. The weight decay will be raised to 0.0007 to enhance regularization, given the improvements observed in the peer group history on similar configurations. The optimizer will be changed to 'AdamW' to potentially enhance convergence based on peer performances, ensuring high momentum for stability. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 as it has shown effectiveness, alongside the SGD optimizer which is familiar in this context. The mu value will be slightly increased to 0.06 to apply regularization in SplitFed consistent with the peers' performance while still ensuring suitable exploration of parameters. Overall, these adjustments are made to reinforce performance capabilities while adhering to the strict constraints outlined."

This suggests that decreasing the learning rate helped stabilize training and may have mitigated some risk of overfitting. To further enhance performance while staying within the allowed constraints, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0005 and also adjust the dropout rate since it's at a higher value, suggesting a little adjustment down to 0.35 could help strike a balance between regularization and learning performance. Regarding weight decay, it is already at 0.0005, which is effective for controlling overfitting, so I will keep this value. The momentum remains effective at 0.9, so I will also retain this. The batch size is kept at 128, taking advantage of the client's high-resource capability. Finally, I will maintain the optimizer as 'AdamW', which has shown effectiveness in the past. For the server settings, we will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and the momentum at 0.9 since these choices have not shown issues.

The weight decay of 0.0001 was the same in peer 84's success, so it is safe to keep at this level for better regularization. Given the need for stable training on low-resource clients, I will keep the batch size at 16 (previously used) to prevent instability and use an optimizer of 'Adam' which is appropriate for image classification tasks. The momentum remains at 0.9 per standard practice in these settings. The dropout rate is set to 0.3 as a moderate level to help prevent overfitting. Regarding the federated server parameters, since both the client and server require adaptive learning rates, I will retain the server's learning rate at 0.001 and kept the same momentum of 0.9 for consistency.

To address this, I will slightly increase the learning rate while ensuring it remains within the specified constraints. I will select a learning rate of 0.00015, which is at the upper limit of the allowed range. This is a strategic move to encourage better feature learning without overwhelming the low-resource client. Regarding weight decay, the previous configuration used a value of 0.0001, which I will keep the same to prevent over-regularization. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it has stabilized the training well in past attempts. The optimizer will continue to be Adam, given its robustness in training deep networks. The scheduler will be set to 'None', as experimentation didn't reveal any improvements with it so far. The local epochs will be kept at 2 since this has allowed sufficient training iterations without exceeding resource constraints. I will lower the batch size to 8 to better accommodate the limitations of the client capacity. Lastly, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3, as a higher dropout can help mitigate potential overfitting issues while conforming to the constraints. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 to maintain stability, with the same optimizer as the client.

The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen because it is known for effective performance on image classification tasks. The scheduler set to 'None' is consistent with the previous configurations, as no scheduler was noted to be beneficial enough in their last experiment. I will keep 'local_epochs' at 2 due to previous stability and performance. The batch size will remain at 16 to balance resource constraints without sacrificing too much performance. I will increase the dropout_rate slightly to 0.4 to further mitigate the risk of overfitting, given the reasonably high training accuracy observed. For the server parameters, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.0002 reflecting the client\u2019s experience while giving room for robust optimization; 0.9 momentum and 'Adam' for the optimizer will ensure stability and speed.

Based on the feedback from the peers, there seems to be some success with learning rates lower than 0.0005, suggesting that a learning rate of 0.0003 might still provide reasonable performance without overfitting. The client has also used dropout rates of 0.1 and 0.2 without clear evidence of overfitting, but to increase robustness, I will opt for a higher dropout rate of 0.3. The weight decay will be set to a modest 0.0001 for regularization, slightly lower than the previous configuration, to reduce possible overfitting while remaining within the constraints. A momentum of 0.9 will be retained as it is common in this architecture and was previously successful. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' since it has been beneficial without introducing instability, and the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler makes sense to help adapt the learning rate over epochs. On the server side, the parameters are primarily unchanged, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001, allowing for stable server aggregate updates, with momentum still at 0.9 and optimizer as 'AdamW', fitting within the allowed ranges.

Therefore, a similar learning_rate of 0.0003 is optimal to prevent underfitting, which is critical for a medium-resource client. For weight_decay, I recommend 0.0005 as it balances regularization and learning capacity for the ResNet18 model. Momentum is set at 0.9 to favor stability during training. The optimizer remains as AdamW, as it showed effectiveness in peer history. To ensure that the client has enough capability to learn effectively without overwhelming their resources, I will set local_epochs to 2 and use a batch_size of 32. The dropout_rate will be set to 0.4 to help mitigate any potential overfitting. For the server, I will align with the peer\u2019s choices by keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 for consistency.

However, to mitigate potential overfitting, I will increase the weight_decay from 0.0001 to 0.0005, which is still within the allowed range and can help improve test accuracy. The momentum will be held at 0.9, as this is a commonly effective value. For the optimizer, I will continue with 'Adam' since the client has previously used it successfully. The scheduler will remain as 'CosineAnnealingLR' for smooth learning rate adjustments in the training process. Keeping local_epochs at 3 is optimal due to the client\u2019s high-resource capacity, which allows for maximized learning per data segment. The batch_size will remain at 128, which is manageable and provides sufficient training batches. Lastly, I will increase the dropout_rate to 0.3, helping to further combat any overfitting by randomly dropping out units during training, leading to a more robust model. For the server-side parameters, I will match the learning rate and momentum with the client's settings unless improvements are indicated, keeping simplicity in coordination. So, a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 in the server will be consistent. The optimizer for the server will also be 'Adam'.

The adjustments will focus on increasing the learning rate within the allowed constraints since both training and testing accuracies are relatively low compared to optimal values for similar workloads. Peers are achieving higher accuracy at a range where a learning rate and weight decay combination benefit performance. Thus, I will set the learning rate at the maximum of 0.0002, as this is closer to threshold ranges they are using successfully. The weight decay will be chosen on the upper limit of its range at 0.0005 to combat potential overfitting by regularizing the model more aggressively. The momentum remains at 0.9, maintaining consistency with previous successful configurations. The optimizer will be 'AdamW' to leverage adaptive learning rates effectively. I'll keep 'None' for the scheduler since current configurations didn't utilize it and to avoid additional complexity. The local epochs will be set to 2 as it balances between training intensity and avoiding too much resource consumption. The batch size will remain at 16 as suggested previously to optimize performance without taxing client resources too heavily. Finally, I will set the dropout rate at 0.4 to maintain regularization without risking too much model capability. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0005, which worked previously, momentum at 0.9, and 'AdamW' for the optimizer. The scheduler remains 'None' to keep changes minimal while adhering to patterning observed in effective setups.

Given the guidelines, I decided to lower the learning rate slightly to 0.0001 to combat any signs of overfitting while remaining within required constraints. The weight decay will be set higher to 0.001 to further assist in regularization and reduce overfitting risk. I kept the momentum at 0.9, consistent with the client's previous successes, and retained 'AdamW' as it's performing well in previous training runs. The 'None' scheduler is appropriate here due to the small learning rate, maintaining a straightforward approach to training. I suggest maintaining the local epochs at 2 for stability, and I recommend adjusting the batch size to 16 as it strikes a balance with computing time in a medium-resource cluster. The dropout rate is adjusted to 0.3 for added regularization without veering into underfitting territory. For the server configuration, I'll recommend a learning rate of 0.001 since it aligns with effective training speeds seen in peer history. The same momentum and optimizer values are maintained for consistency and performance. Finally, I will keep the mu value at 0.01, as it aligns with current methodologies in federated learning and has been effectively utilized in previous setups.",

The current learning rate of 0.0005 is already pushing towards the upper limit of the client's allowed range (0.0001 to 0.0003), so we need to decrease it slightly to avoid potential overfitting. The previous weight decay of 0.0005 is at the maximum of its range, so I'll suggest lower value of 0.0001 for more regularization. Given the peer history and that dropout rates above 0.1 yielded a noticeable improvement in accuracy, we can increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to further combat overfitting. The batch size should be kept at 16 as the client has previously used it successfully. A local epoch count of 2 remains optimal for this capacity setup. For the server, I will keep the existing values the same as they are well within limits and have shown stable performance.

Based on guidance for underfitting, I recommend increasing the learning rate to 0.002 which is still within the limits but aggressive enough to potentially improve convergence. To combat any overfitting that may occur with this increased learning rate, I'll apply a slightly higher weight decay of 0.0007. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' aligns with the previous success and is known for its robustness. I'll also maintain the current local_epochs of 3 and use a batch_size of 128, as these are optimal given the high-resource cluster capabilities. The dropout rate will remain at 0.3 to strike a balance between regularization and allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server, I\u2019m keeping a learning rate of 0.001 since it aligns with the best practices and the previous setups for effectiveness. The server's momentum will also remain at 0.9, and the optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' to ensure consistency in training dynamics across client and server.

I will keep the optimizer as 'Adam' since 'SGD' may not be optimal for small batches. A drop in batch size to 16 (lowering from 24) would leverage available resources and potentially help reduce overfitting by increasing the variance in updates. For the server, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 and 'AdamW' optimizer will support consistency across client-server learning dynamics.

The learning rate of 0.001 is already at the upper limit of the client's constraints, which may be a potential cause for overfitting. Therefore, I suggest maintaining the learning rate at 0.001, given that higher rates could lead to instability. However, the weight decay should be increased to 0.0001 to improve regularization and further combat overfitting. The dropout rate is set at 0.4 to introduce more regularization since the current value of 0.3 could still allow for some degree of overfitting. Additionally, I will increase the local epochs to 3 to allow more training on each client\u2019s data while capitalizing on the high resource capacity. The batch size is maximized to 256, in line with the client's high resource availability. For the server parameters, I recommend keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 with the AdamW optimizer since this has worked well so far. The scheduler will remain as 'None' to maintain full control over the learning rate without introducing further complexity. Lastly, I will set the mu value to 0.01, which aligns well within the lower range of the specified limits, providing enough control for the federated settings without being overly aggressive.",

Increasing the weight decay to 0.0001 will add regularization to combat overfitting, as high training accuracy but lower testing accuracy indicates that the model is learning noise.

I will retain the local epochs at 2, as this is currently yielding reasonable results without over-training. For batch size, I will opt for 128 since it's within the allowed values and the client is high-resource, meaning they can handle it without sacrificing performance. Keeping the dropout rate at 0.3 is reasonable as it should already provide some regularization.

The weight_decay will be set to 1e-04 to provide some level of regularization without being excessively strong. For momentum, I'll select 0.9, which is commonly effective. The optimizer will be AdamW, as it generally performs well in image classification tasks. I've chosen the StepLR scheduler to help manage learning rates during training. The local_epochs are set to 2 to allow for sufficient training iterations without overwhelming the client resources. The batch_size is set at 16, which is modest and should be manageable for the client's limited capacity. A dropout_rate of 0.2 is moderate and can help prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server parameters, I've aligned the learning_rate and momentum choices to ensure consistency, both set to 0.001 and 0.9 respectively with the same AdamW optimizer, while scheduling is set to 'None' as no specific scheduling strategy is currently required.

Local_epochs will be set to 2, providing a moderate training duration per round. On the server-side, I will match the learning_rate and momentum with the client to ensure consistency.

The weight_decay will be increased slightly to 0.0005, following the hint from the client's history that calls for regularization to potentially improve generalization since their test accuracy is high. The optimizer will remain 'SGD' as the client has a consistent history with it, and a momentum of 0.9 is being retained for stability. A moderate batch size of 16 is selected since the client has performed well with it, and dropout_rate will be kept at 0.35, balancing the need to avoid overfitting while still providing some regularization. For the server, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.001, as it has shown effectiveness in obtaining reasonable test accuracy. Finally, the mu parameter will remain at 0.05 to balance the federated learning regularization without adding unnecessary complexity. Overall, the selections prioritize stability, consistency, and a slight enhancement to generalization."

Client 443 used a learning rate of 0.0001 and achieved 75.80% accuracy, while Client 335 used a learning rate of 0.0005 and achieved 77.89% accuracy. As the learning rate affects the training dynamics significantly, I suggest starting on the higher end of the scale with 0.0005 to help improve learning without being too aggressive. Both peers used the AdamW optimizer, which has been consistent and effective, thus I will also recommend it for our client. The weight decay used by Client 443 (0.0005) seems to provide a balance of regularization, so I will keep that value. The momentum value (0.9) is common and effective in practice, so I\u2019ll keep it there as well. For local epochs, I will set it to 2 as per peer history, which allows decent training without risking overfitting. For batch size, I will choose 32, which is a reasonable middle ground for moderate resource clients. I will set the dropout rate to 0.3, consistent with peer history, to help mitigate overfitting. Finally, since peers had a mu of 0.01, I will keep this value for server-side consistency.",

Therefore, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0004 to adhere to constraints but maintain enough speed in training processes, keeping in mind the recorded success with similar parameters. Peer Client 335 achieved 77.89% with a learning rate of 0.0005 \u2014 however, with our current constraints, we should approach conservatively. For regularization, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0004 to help mitigate any signs of overfitting. The dropout_rate will remain at 0.3, matching past successful configurations. The client\u2019s batch_size will stay at 32 since it provides a good balance for medium-resource capabilities. I will set local_epochs to 2, as this has been common among peers and fits within the constraints. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW', showing effectiveness in previous runs. The server parameters will mirror the client learning rate but sit within the broader range \u2014 thus, I\u2019ll keep it at 0.001 with the same optimizer and momentum.

Finally, I'll increase the dropout to 0.3 to mitigate potential overfitting more aggressively.

The dropout rate will be set to 0.4, as it has been effective in the past yet maintains a balance to avoid excessive regularization. For the server parameters, I will retain the same values used previously, with a learning rate of 0.001 due to its effectiveness in peer history, alongside the chosen optimizer (AdamW) and momentum (0.9) to ensure consistency in optimization across clients. The mu value remains at 0.01, providing essential regularization without being overly restrictive.",

Keeping the weight decay at 0.0001 provides regularization without being too aggressive, and it remains within the acceptable range. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 as it is in line with the peer successful practices.

For the server, I will stick to a learning rate of 0.001 as it has been consistently effective across multiple trials. The momentum is again set to 0.9 to align with established practices.

The momentum will remain at 0.9, as this has been effective in previous configurations. The optimizer will also be set to 'SGD', as this has been the baseline in past configurations showing satisfactory accuracy. Considering the importance of dropout in preventing overfitting, the dropout rate will be set to 0.3, which is on the higher end but still under the limit, aligning with some successful peer experiments. Finally, I will use a batch size of 16 as it has been previously concentrated in successful tests, adhering to the constraint of low-resource capabilities. The server parameters will maintain the same effective learning rate of 0.0005 and optimizer settings to retain consistency in training across clients.

The image classification task with ResNet18 can be sensitive to learning rates and weight decay. I'll choose a learning rate of 0.001, which is middle-ground and should allow for reasonable convergence without being too aggressive. The weight decay will be set to 0.0001, promoting regularization without being overly restrictive, given that overfitting is not yet evident from historical data since this is a first run. For the optimizer, I will select 'AdamW' as it typically provides better results in image classification tasks compared to SGD, especially when dealing with moderate resources. Considering the client\u2019s capacity, a batch size of 32 strikes a balance between convergence speed and resource utilization. I'll set local_epochs to 2, which allows a moderate amount of training while ensuring the model doesn't overfit due to excessive training on the local data. A dropout rate of 0.2 is suggested to prevent overfitting while still allowing the network to learn meaningful patterns. On the server side, I will use the same learning rate of 0.001 and the 'AdamW' optimizer. The momentum will be set to 0.9, which is a common choice and generally effective. Lastly, I will not use a scheduler on the server for simplicity as there are no prior runs to indicate the need for scheduling adjustments. I will set mu to 0.01 for FedProx regularization, which keeps the distributed training balanced while providing some level of robustness to adverse gradients.",

This increase can foster faster convergence while ensuring it does not exceed typical instability thresholds for CNNs on Cifar10.

I will set the local epochs to 2, a good compromise between training efficiency and convergence without risking overfitting, as suggested by the history.

The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to help combat any potential overfitting detected from the higher training accuracy previously reached. The dropout rate will remain at 0.2, striking a balance between preventing overfitting and maintaining model robustness. For the optimizer, 'AdamW' was effective in their last run, so it is retained. The local epochs remain at 2, given the medium resource allowance, and to keep the computational load manageable. As for the server parameters, I will set a learning rate of 0.001, as this has been effective before, and keep the optimizer as 'AdamW'.

Therefore, I will set the learning_rate to 0.0005 to start, which is conservative enough to prevent oscillations. The weight_decay parameter is also important for regularization; a weight_decay value of 0.0005 aligns with what has worked for peer client 109 and avoids overfitting. For momentum, I will select 0.9 as seen across peers and it allows some stability during SGD updates. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW' as it offers good performance on image classification tasks. I choose 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the scheduler, which is effective for long training sessions as it helps adjust the learning rate effectively. Suggested local_epochs is 2 based on peer practices, allowing for thorough training without becoming too time-consuming. A batch_size of 64 is optimal for high-resource clients like this one, allowing sufficient throughput. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.3 gives a good balance between giving the model enough capacity while preventing overfitting. On the server side, I will replicate the success of peers with a learning rate of 0.001, using the same optimizer and momentum configuration.

However, since the test accuracy is still not optimal, increasing the learning rate slightly might help in achieving better results. Given the client's capacity as a 'High-Resource' client, I will increase the 'learning_rate' to 0.0007, which remains conservative and is still within the specified range. The 'weight_decay' will be raised slightly to 0.0002 to provide better regularization in case of potential overfitting from the increased learning rate. I will keep the 'momentum' fixed at 0.9 as it has proven effective in past configurations. The optimizer will be switched from 'Adam' to 'AdamW' based on peer success with 'AdamW', indicating that this may yield more reliable results. The batch size will remain at 64 since it was previously effective and fixed options are provided. The 'dropout_rate' will be slightly increased to 0.3, a value that balances between keeping the model capacity and reducing overfitting risk. For the server-side parameters, I will retain the previous values since they have aligned with the client\u2019s learning rate and momentum, ensuring stability across federated learning. The value of 'mu' will be maintained at 0.01 allowing flexibility in the adaptive regularization.

There\u2019s no indication of overfitting from the data given, so I will keep the weight_decay relatively low at 0.0005. The momentum at 0.9 appears effective, and I will maintain it to ensure the optimizer retains momentum in weight updates. The AdamW optimizer is performing well, so it will remain unchanged. As for the local_epochs, 2 is a balanced choice given the resource constraints and should provide enough updates without overloading the system. A batch_size of 32 is optimal for a medium-resource client, striking a balance between training speed and memory usage. The dropout rate of 0.3 seems adequate, but since we're adjusting other hyperparameters as well, I will reduce it slightly to 0.25 to maintain a healthy complexity-regularization balance. For the server parameters, a learning_rate of 0.005 is steady, and I\u2019ll keep the optimizer and scheduler consistent with the client side.

The momentum of 0.9 has been consistently used, which is favorable for client stability, and I will retain it. The optimizer 'Adam' has also been effective, and I will maintain that as it performs well with gradient updates in CNNs. The batch_size of 16 is appropriate given their current capacity and performance, so I will keep it, along with local_epochs set to 2. I will also slightly increase the dropout_rate to 0.35 to help with generalization due to the high test accuracy compared to previous results. For the server, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 since they are within the recommended range and have shown some effectiveness in the most recent training rounds. Using the same optimizer 'AdamW' remains consistent with previous choices for robust weight updates. Keeping the scheduler as 'StepLR' also ensures a gradual decrease in the learning rate for efficiency. The mu value can be slightly decreased from 0.05 to 0.04 to provide a better regularization effect in the SplitFed configuration, aiming for consistency in the overall client-server synchrony."

I'll set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is a standard choice for starting training as it is neither too aggressive nor too passive, thus helping to prevent both underfitting and overfitting in this initial round. For weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0001 to introduce a small amount of regularization to help mitigate overfitting without being too harsh. The momentum will be set to 0.9 as it is a typical value that can help speed up convergence in the optimization process. I will choose the Adam optimizer since it generally performs well for image classification tasks. The scheduler will be set to 'StepLR', which allows for scheduled learning rate decay, aiding in fine-tuning as training progresses. For local_epochs, setting it to 2 would provide a balance between training time and allowing the client to learn effectively on their dataset. A batch_size of 64 is both manageable for a medium-resource client and typically effective in image classification. Lastly, I will set the dropout_rate to 0.3 to help regularize the model without overly disrupting the learning process. On the server side, I will mirror some optimally default values, using the same learning_rate, optimizer, and momentum to ensure consistency and effective global training dynamics. I will set the server scheduler to 'None' for simplicity in this round.

The weight decay will be increased slightly to 0.0005 as it helps in regularization, which is crucial given we want to retain the performance without overfitting on training data. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as it balances convergence speed and stability. For the optimizer, I've chosen 'AdamW' as it\u2019s effective for image classification tasks and supports weight decay directly. The local epochs will remain at 2, which is reasonable for the client\u2019s capacity, and the batch size is kept at 64 as it is the largest allowed, which is more efficient for medium-resource clients. Finally, I'm increasing the dropout rate to 0.4 to promote generalization and reduce overfitting. On the server side, I'll keep the learning rate at 0.001, as that is a solid starting point for server-side consistency, maintaining the same momentum of 0.9, and the optimizer 'AdamW' for synchronizing the training process effectively. The scheduler is set to 'None' to simplify the overall strategy given the client's current settings. I will set mu to 0.01, which is within range and aligns with previous settings, providing a balance in federated learning parameters."

The dropout rate will remain at 0.3 since there is no indication it needs modification, given the last known performance.

I have noted that their learning rate of 0.0005 provides a balance between training speed and stability, so I will choose a similar value. The weight decay can help mitigate potential overfitting, so I will set it close to the peer's at 0.0005. A momentum of 0.9 is standard for balancing exploration and convergence in SGD optimizers, so I will use that value. Given that we are using ResNet18 and image classification, I decided on the AdamW optimizer, which is effective due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities. The batch size is set to 64, considering the high-resource capability of the client. A dropout rate of 0.3, which is a balanced choice that was successfully utilized by Client 325, will help with regularization.

Since the model is performing well, but adjusting hyperparameters might yield even better results. Given this context, I will opt for a slightly higher learning rate of 0.001 to enhance convergence without causing underfitting, as previous settings (e.g., 0.0015) were not optimal but lower values in peer designs were also insufficient. I will increase the weight decay to 0.0008 to combat any potential overfitting, particularly since the test accuracy was below 82%, leading to a conservative approach. The momentum remains at 0.9, which has proven effective. The chosen optimizer is 'AdamW' for its robustness in training deep networks. The batch size will be 48, as increased capacity compared to prior runs should help leverage client resources effectively. The dropout rate will be raised to 0.4 to reduce overfitting further by regularizing the model more aggressively. My suggestion for the server includes maintaining a learning rate of 0.0005, which is conservative yet effective in stabilizing federated learning. I will also preserve the choice of 'AdamW' for consistency, with the scheduler still as 'None' to avoid adding further complexity during training iterations. The mu value will remain at 0.01 to keep the regularization strategy for federated learning effective.",

The previous learning rate (0.001) is at the upper limit of the allowed range for clients, so I will decrease it to 0.0005 to allow for more gradual updates, which is advisable for low-resource clients. Weight decay will be increased to 0.0001 for better regularization since the test accuracy is reasonably high, suggesting potential overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has been effective in past configurations. The optimizer will stay as 'Adam', which is commonly effective for image classification tasks. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow the learning rate to decay adequately over epochs. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.25 to help mitigate overfitting further. For server parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001, momentum at 0.9, and the optimizer as 'Adam', similar to the client. The scheduler will be set to 'None' for the server as it may help maintain a stable convergence during this phase.

This suggests a lower learning rate is beneficial for stability and may mitigate overfitting. Sticking closer to the last optimal learning rate, I will keep it at 0.0002, which has shown good performance. The weight decay remains at 0.0005 to continue regularization without excessively constraining the model. The momentum is kept at 0.9, which is effective in helping the optimizer converge smoothly. The optimizer 'AdamW' is retained for its adaptive capabilities, particularly suitable for image problems. The batch size is maintained at 16 since lower resource clients benefit from smaller batch sizes to avoid overloading. The dropout rate is kept at 0.4 as it is likely aiding in managing overfitting, and this value is well within the acceptable range. Thus, these adjustments aim for better convergence and overall test accuracy for the low-resource client. For the server configuration, similar trajectories in learning rates and momentum will ensure consistency, with the working rate set to 0.0002 and other parameters mirroring the client settings. Finally, mu is sustained at 0.01 as it balances the contribution from the local and global model.

I will keep the weight_decay at 0.0005 for regularization, as it has not adversely affected performance so far. The momentum is set to 0.9, consistent with the client's history and peer performance. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' for its efficiency in convergence. The local_epochs will be set to 2 to balance between training time and model accuracy. The batch_size is fixed at 16 since that's the maximum smaller batch size recommended for low-resource clients, helping with stability. A dropout_rate of 0.4 will help with generalization given the previous use without negative effects. For the server hyperparameters, I will adopt the same learning_rate of 0.0002 and 0.9 momentum, consistent with the client's choice, to streamline training.

A learning rate of 0.0002 is optimal as it's less than the previous rate and aligns with the adaptation strategy. For weight decay, I will slightly increase it to 0.0002 to help mitigate any overfitting risks, which is particularly relevant given the moderate test performance. The momentum is kept at 0.9, matching the peer's settings, which is typically effective in conjunction with AdamW. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' as it has performed well in previous trials. The dropout rate remains at 0.4 to balance regularization without being too aggressive, maintaining what has yielded acceptable test results previously. The batch size is fixed at 16 as per constraints and compatibility with the client's moderate capacity. The local epochs remain at 3 since this allows sufficient training without overwhelming the client\u2019s resources. On the server side, the learning rate is kept at 0.001, as this approach has shown stability in peer tests, ensuring effective communication and updates during federated learning. The optimizer on the server also remains 'AdamW,' with scheduling set to 'None' since peers did not report improved performance with a scheduler.

Based on the guidance, a lower learning rate would help improve generalization but must remain within 0.0001 - 0.0002. To address potential overfitting (as the accuracy is high but we have a small range of hyperparameters), I'll set the learning rate to the maximum allowed of 0.0002 while also increasing weight_decay to the maximum of 0.0002 for better regularization. This should help reduce overfitting. The dropout rate has helped improve generalization (increased from 0.3 to 0.4 previously), so I will keep it at 0.4 to support continued improvements. The momentum will stay at 0.9 as it has been consistent in previous configurations with no negative impact. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' since it has previously yielded good results and fits the problem requirements. For the batch size, 32 has been effective, so I'll keep that along with local_epochs set at 3. On the server side, the learning rate stays at 0.001 as it fits the requirements and has shown to work well in past configurations.

The successful peer (Client 123) used relatively conservative hyperparameters, suggesting stability in performance. I will adopt a learning_rate of 0.0003 as it balances well between the extremes and is likely not to lead to instability. The weight_decay of 0.0001 will help prevent overfitting without significantly affecting learning. A momentum of 0.9 is reasonable as it is commonly effective in optimizers like AdamW. The optimizer will be set to AdamW since it is shown to perform well in image classification tasks. The local_epochs will be set to 3, providing sufficient training on local data without overwhelming computational resources. A batch_size of 16 ensures that the model is trained efficiently without exceeding the client's medium-resource capacity. A dropout_rate of 0.4 is aimed at mitigating overfitting, given that it's a common issue in image classification and is consistent with the peer\u2019s choice. For server parameters, I will mirror the learning_rate and momentum from the client, and I will also use the AdamW optimizer since it works well generally in federated learning scenarios. A scheduler is not set for the server in this instance, to maintain straightforward training without complexity. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is aligned with typical practice and balances between client differences during federated training.",

This indicates that the client's choices are solid, but there is still room for optimization towards the lower end of the learning rate spectrum. I will decrease the learning_rate to 0.0002, which is closer to the maximum allowed, as the client's accuracy remains competitive. The weight_decay will be increased slightly to 0.0002 to further help with regularization and reduce any potential overfitting, given that a momentum of 0.9 has proven effective historically. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW', aligning with high accuracy performances. I also maintain the dropout_rate at 0.4, as it is consistent with the client's preferences and has not shown any direct negative impact. The local_epochs will stay at 3 to ensure robust training, and the batch_size will remain at 16 to fit the resource constraints. For the server, I will slightly adjust the server learning_rate to 0.0005 for a balanced approach as lower learning rates can stabilize server training but should be sufficient to keep up with client updates. The mu value will be kept at 0.01 to maintain the current level of FedProx regularization. These adjustments aim to enhance convergence and generalization without violating existing constraints."

To optimize the performance, I recommend slight adjustments based on both observed accuracy and the provided guidance. 1. **Client Learning Rate**: I will reduce the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005. The test accuracy is lower than optimal, suggesting potential overfitting; a lower learning rate can stabilize training. 2. **Weight Decay**: I will increase the weight decay from 0.0001 to 0.0005 to enhance regularization. This aligns with the guidance indicating that a higher weight decay may help combat overfitting when training accuracy exceeds test accuracy. 3. **Batch Size**: I will keep the batch size at 64 because it's already at the maximum for the client\u2019s capacity, and there are no constraints to reduce it further (the allowed sizes are 32 or 16). 4. **Dropout Rate**: I will increase the dropout rate from 0.1 to 0.2. Since dropout helps to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0, this should assist in improving the model's generalizability. 5. **Server Learning Rate and Optimizer**: The server parameters remain unchanged (learning rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, optimizer as AdamW, scheduler as None), as these values align well with expected needs and the current state of the training. 6. **mu Parameter**: I will maintain mu at 0.01, which provides a sensible balance between local training and the central model's effect, ensuring effective federated learning under the FedProx scheme.",

The weight decay is set at 1e-04 to help with regularization without being overly restrictive, considering they have not run any previous rounds that could indicate overfitting. A momentum of 0.9 is optimal for smooth convergence and is within the recommended range. The optimizer is set to 'Adam', which is often effective for image classification tasks like this, providing adaptive learning rates. A smaller batch size of 16 is chosen to fit the low-resource context, which will help with memory constraints. I've set the local epochs to 2, balancing the need for training with the limited computational resources. Finally, I selected a dropout rate of 0.1 as a precaution against overfitting since the task is image classification, which can be prone to this issue. For the server, I will align the learning rate to 0.001 for consistency, maintain the same momentum and optimizer for coherence across client-server operations, and use 'None' for the scheduler to avoid additional complexity during this initial round.

Given that the test accuracy achieved was 71.62%, indicating room for improvement and considering the low-resource environment of the client, I've opted for a lower learning rate of 0.0005. This will help stabilize training given the client's limitations. The weight decay is set at 0.0001, which is fairly low; I'll keep it, as the potential underfitting can be retained without a significant weight decay increase at this stage. Momentum is suggested at 0.9, which is consistent with the client's prior setup and within the allowed range. I've chosen the 'AdamW' optimizer due to its advantages in adapting learning rates. The batch size is minimized to 8 from 16 to better match the low resources of the client. The local epochs are constrained to 2, balancing training time against resource usage. The dropout rate is increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting while allowing the model to learn from the available data. For the server settings, I will align the learning rate to 0.001 to remain effective at a federation level, with a momentum of 0.9 and using the 'AdamW' optimizer for consistency across systems. The mu is suggested to be 0.01 to maintain a reasonable balance in regularization. Overall, these hyperparameters are expected to improve the training stability and performance for the low-resource setup."

The most recent configuration achieved a test accuracy of 75.76% which indicates improvement, however, the client is in a low-resource scenario which necessitates values for hyperparameters that facilitate more stable training. Given that learning rates are currently set at 0.0005, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0003, approaching the client's lower capacity ability to train while still being effective. The weight decay will also be increased to 0.0003, which is the maximum allowed, to combat any risk of overfitting as we tighten the learning rate. The momentum is retained at 0.9, as this value has shown stability in the past. For the optimizer, AdamW remains in place, given its adaptability in handling different capacities. The dropout rate will be increased slightly to 0.4, to further aid generalization and combat potential overfitting risks identified in training versus testing accuracies. The batch size will remain at 16 due to its historical performance and because it fits within the allowed parameters for the low-resource setup. Local epochs will also be set to 2 to ensure enough training time without over-committing resources. For the server, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.0005 since the server's performance is not limited in the same way, and consistency is beneficial during federated learning where different client improvements can be integrated. The fluctuation in the learning rate for the server and client is justified; thus, I maintain a learning rate of 0.0005 which also fits within the constraints.

For weight decay, I will suggest 0.0005 to introduce more regularization and mitigate potential overfitting, particularly if previously high training accuracy is observed but not translated to the test accuracy. The optimizer remains as 'Adam', which was effectively utilized before, maintaining consistency. The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.4 to further combat overfitting, given the improvements seen in other peers. The batch size will stay at 16 as it has been effective for this client. For local_epochs, I will maintain it at 3, given the client's moderate resource use and the need for sufficient learning. On the server side, I suggest a learning rate of 0.001 which has also been effective in previous configurations. The momentum will be kept at 0.9 and the optimizer remains 'AdamW' for its proven performance.

Considering the moderate resource capacity of the client, I will set the learning rate to 0.0003 to ensure a balanced start without risking underfitting or overfitting. The weight_decay will also be set to 0.0003, matching client 397, as it appears effective for similar tasks. Momentum is set at 0.9 to maintain momentum continuity as seen in peers. The optimizer 'AdamW' is selected for better performance in image classification scenarios. A local_epochs value of 2 is chosen as it balances training time with optimization potential, which is consistent with peer choices, and a batch_size of 32 is selected for effective resource utilization given the medium capacity. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is chosen which has been effective in previous cases, helping to mitigate the risk of overfitting without compromising performance.

Given that the learning rate needs to be lowered to fit within the strict constraints, I will select a learning rate of 0.0002, which is still a reasonably high learning rate conducive for getting better results. The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0005 to help combat any potential overfitting, as consistent results from peer clients suggest that increasing weight decay generally aids in regularization. I'll keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' since it appears effective across peer usage. The batch size will be adjusted to 16 since it is more appropriate for medium-resource clients, and keeping the local_epochs at 2 balances training time with resource constraints. I will set the dropout_rate to 0.3 as it is already providing a reasonable level of regularization without being too prohibitive. For the server parameters, keeping the learning_rate at 0.001, the same as previous settings, should maintain stability as it fits well within the performance bounds seen across peers. I will opt for 'AdamW' with the same settings, as consistency might lead to better synergy during training. Finally, mu will be set to 0.01, aligning with prior rounds and allowing for slight regularization without introducing significant instability."

Since the training performance was better than the test, this indicates potential overfitting. To address this, I will increase the weight decay to 0.0006 for better regularization. Given that the client can handle higher batch sizes, I will increase the batch size to 256. The momentum remains at 0.9. The optimizer 'SGD' performed well previously and will be retained. For dropout, I will keep it at 0.3 since we are only making minor adjustments. The local_epochs will remain at 2 as it provides a good balance of training without overfitting too quickly. The server parameters will stay largely the same as the client used 'SGD', and given success, I will retain a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9. The mu value will be maintained at 0.01 since it was effective. This combination should balance learning rates appropriately and help mitigate overfitting.",

However, the learning rate is slightly above the ideal maximum range for this configuration. Based on guidance for tuning hyperparameters and the client\u2019s capacity, it is beneficial to reduce the learning rate while maintaining a consistent optimizer like AdamW. Since the previous rounds showed strong performance with this setup, especially with a gradually increased dropout rate (0.3) in the last epoch, maintaining this value should help manage overfitting while allowing for sufficient model flexibility. The weight decay will be adjusted slightly to 0.0005 to help with regularization without hampering the learning rate. Given that the batch size of 64 is evidently not an option anymore, I recommend increasing it to 128, which is aligned with the high-resource capability of the client.

The client's history is non-existent, so I will base my choices on what has worked for peers. Client 275 achieved reasonable accuracy with a learning rate of 0.0003, which is moderately low, thus I'll adopt the same learning rate to ensure stability. The weight decay of 1e-05 is also used by peer clients and will aid in regularization; although low, it aligns with the idea of avoiding overfitting in low-resource setups. I\u2019ll set momentum to 0.9, consistent with peer usage, providing a good balance during training. I selected the SGD optimizer due to its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks. Unlike the batch size of 32 used by some peers, I opted for 16 to accommodate the low-resource nature, allowing gradual updates without overwhelming the client. The dropout rate is set to 0.2, which is conservative and should help mitigate potential overfitting. Given that local epochs are generally between 1 and 3, I will set it to 2 for decent convergence without excessive computational load. On the server side, I will mirror the same learning rate of 0.001 and use SGD as seen in peers' settings. The momentum is kept at 0.9 for stability. I\u2019ll set the scheduler to None since it provides more straightforward training without adjustments that require added computational overhead. Finally, I am setting the mu value to 0.01 based on peer choices, balancing the FedProx regularization effect without making it overly dominant.",

However, looking at the peer's history of Client 245, who utilized a learning rate of 0.0002, a weight decay of 0.0005, and achieved a test accuracy of 76.11%, I will use this as a reference point. Given the medium-resource capacity of our client, a moderate `learning_rate` and `batch_size` will be employed. The `learning_rate` is set at 0.0002 to avoid aggressive updates. A moderate `weight_decay` of 0.0005 will help in regularization without excessively penalizing the weights, addressing any potential overfitting concerns due to the relatively complex nature of the ResNet18 model. The `momentum` will be set to 0.9 to accelerate gradients and effectively navigate through adverse local minima. I will select `AdamW` as the optimizer because it balances the benefits of adaptive learning rates with weight decay regularization. The `scheduler` uses `CosineAnnealingLR` to adapt the learning rate over epochs, ensuring smooth convergence. For `local_epochs`, I chose 2 to provide the model with sufficient iterations to learn from the local dataset without risking overfitting. A `batch_size` of 16 is optimal for medium-resource clients, ensuring more stable updates and manageable resource utilization, while a `dropout_rate` of 0.3 introduces regularization to combat overfitting in deeper architectures. For the server settings, I suggest the same learning rate of 0.001 based on consistency with the client and 0.9 momentum, utilizing `AdamW` for optimization and no learning rate scheduler to simplify the server-side training process.

This indicates potential overfitting since the test accuracy is lower than the initial performance but also aligns closely with the current settings. To address this, I propose slightly increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0006 to help regularize the model better while maintaining a more conservative `learning_rate` of 0.0002 to prevent training instability. The `batch_size` is reduced to 16 considering the medium-resource capacity of the client. Since dropout was already tested at 0.3, maintaining this value will allow us to see its effect on this new configuration. The server maintains the previous setup for consistency in communication with clients, thus keeping the server's `learning_rate` same at 0.001. Lastly, the value for `mu` remains at 0.01 for the federated learning framework, as it has shown reasonable performance.",

However, it's outside the strict constraints of 0.0001 to 0.0003. Therefore, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0003 as it's the maximum allowed while still adhering to the 'lower learning rates for overfitting' guidance. The weight decay of 0.0001 is on the lower end, thus I will increase it to 0.0005 for better regularization, as the peer with the better performance had a weight decay of 0.0005. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is a good choice for stability. The optimizer 'AdamW' is performing well, and keeping the scheduler as 'CosineAnnealingLR' should benefit from adaptive learning rates over epochs. Local epochs of 2.0 and batch size of 16 were previously effective, remaining unchanged. Finally, adhering to the constraints for dropout, I will keep it at 0.3 as it has shown a positive impact previously. For the server, the learning rate will be set to 0.001, given that it's reasonable for a higher scale considering the optimal testing results. Maintaining the optimizer as 'AdamW' is wise, along with 'None' for the scheduler to keep it straightforward.

I'll set the learning_rate at 0.0002, maintaining a conservative approach to begin with a low learning rate while ensuring exploration is possible if underfitting occurs. The weight_decay of 0.0005 will help regulate the model and prevent overfitting, which might be necessary since the task is image classification, and the nature of ResNet architectures can lead to overfitting on smaller datasets like CIFAR10. I'll choose a momentum of 0.9, as this has been used successfully by peers and can stabilize training. Given the model and the client capacity, a batch_size of 16 is reasonable, allowing sufficient updates while handling memory constraints. I'll also include a dropout_rate of 0.3 to further mitigate overfitting, which aligns with the guidance for image models and the common practices observed in peer history. For the server, I'll align with the approach of the successful peer, setting the learning_rate to 0.001, utilizing the AdamW optimizer for its adaptive nature in training, combined with a scheduler of 'None' since it is the first round and may simplify initial tuning.

The weight_decay is set to 0.0005, providing regularization to prevent overfitting without hampering learning. As this model is complex (ResNet18), I will utilize a momentum of 0.9 to help accelerate gradients vectors in the correct directions. The selected optimizer is 'AdamW', which has been effective for image classification tasks, especially with weight decay adjustments. The scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR', allowing for adaptive learning rate scheduling, which can optimize convergence. The batch size of 128 is chosen as the client has high capacity, allowing for more stable updates during training. A dropout_rate of 0.25 is reasonable to further reduce overfitting while keeping the model expressive. On the server side, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum from the client settings to ensure consistency in training. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, as a moderate value to balance the impact of the federated scheme without overwhelming the updates.",

Since the last test achieved an accuracy of 80.96% with a learning rate of 0.0003, I suggest lowering it slightly to 0.00025 to allow for finer adjustments without drastic changes that could destabilize training. The weight decay is increased to 0.0007 to enhance regularization as there is a slight indication of overfitting due to recent accuracy improvements. The momentum is kept at 0.9, which has proven effective. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', as it is consistent with the last successful configurations. I will retain a 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler for better learning rate management and maintain a batch size of 128, which balances the client's high-resource capacity. I also suggest increasing the dropout_rate to 0.4 to further combat potential overfitting as test accuracy approaches a plateau. The changes in the server's parameters remain minimal as they have functioned well; hence I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and the optimizer as 'AdamW', ensuring consistency.

The current context indicates a medium-resource client, so a medium batch size of 32 is appropriate. Given that peers tended towards a weight_decay of 0.0001 or 0.0005, and to mitigate the risk of overfitting (with moderate accuracy goals), I\u2019ll set weight_decay at 0.0001. The momentum parameter will be set to 0.9, a common value that improves convergence speed based on peer use. For the optimizer, I will adopt AdamW as it is a well-suited choice for image classification tasks. The dropout_rate will be set to 0.3, which is in line with peer choices and helps manage overfitting. I will use 2 local_epochs similarly to peer history to balance training length. For the server settings, following the same learning_rate of 0.001 ensures sync with client growth while leveraging proven values for momentum and optimizer choice.

However, this is on the higher end of the learning rate spectrum permissible for the constraints. Since the test accuracy might still benefit from more conservative tuning, I propose lowering the learning rate further to 0.0003 to potentially enhance model performance and enforce stability during training. The weight decay will be set to 0.0001 to encourage regularization while fitting the model to the training data effectively. The momentum is retained at 0.9, which aligns with previous successful trials. I will switch the optimizer to AdamW as this has been used by peers with positive outcomes. The local epochs will remain at 2 since changes did not show significant issues and this value is within the allowed range. The batch size will be reduced to 24 to better fit within the medium client capacity and encourage better gradient estimations. The dropout rate will remain at 0.3, as this value has shown moderate success in previous configurations and is within permitted limits. For the server parameters, I maintain the learning rate at 0.001, as it fits the higher end of the range and has produced good performance without risks of overfitting. Lastly, mu is set to 0.01 to maintain stability in the federated scheme while ensuring the benefit of regularization through FedProx. Overall, these adjustments are aimed at optimizing accuracy while adhering strictly to the defined constraints.",

I'll set the learning_rate at 0.0005; it appears to be well-performing for peers, and it is within the optimal range. The weight_decay will be set at 0.0001, which was also used by Client 290 and should prevent overfitting while maintaining reasonable model capacity. The momentum will be set at 0.9, consistent across peer models, facilitating stable training. For the optimizer, I will utilize 'AdamW' because it provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency. A learning rate scheduler ('CosineAnnealingLR') will be included as well to help manage learning rate dynamically; this was successful for peers. For local_epochs, I will set it to 2, which is within the medium-resource capacity of this client, allowing for efficient convergence without overburdening resources. The batch size will be 32, which was also common among peers. Lastly, I'll set the dropout_rate to 0.3 based on Client 290's setup that likely helps with overfitting without severely impacting learning. For server parameters, I will mirror the learning_rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 already established by Client 290, aligning closely with overall successful cases. Finally, I will use 'None' for the server's scheduler as it should have minimal impact given this is the server-side and smooth operations are more critical.

The weight decay currently set at 0.0005 is reasonable, but to further prevent the risk of overfitting and encourage regularization, I will increase it slightly to 0.0007, which is still within the constraint limit. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it is a standard value that typically works well with Adam, which I will also opt for as the optimizer due to its adaptive learning property. The batch size can be set to 128, maximizing the advantages of the high-resource client, and I will keep the dropout rate at 0.3 as it has not been indicated as a cause for severe overfitting. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' proves effective in previous settings, so I will retain that as well.

Additionally, the peer's successful tuning at 81.43% by using 0.0008 weight decay indicates that further increases could still be beneficial. However, I must adhere to the constraints, so I will push weight_decay to its max allowable, which is 0.001. The learning rate will be decreased to 0.0005 to mitigate any overfitting as the test accuracy hover was already reasonable. Keeping momentum at 0.9 is consistent with previous high performances, and hence I suggest using the same value. The optimizer will remain AdamW, as it has been effective in past experiments. The batch size will remain at 128 to stay consistent with previous runs. For dropout, I will increase it to 0.4 to help with regularization since previous settings were on the lower end. On the server-side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 as it aligns with earlier successful runs and will retain the same optimizer and momentum for stability, along with 'None' for the scheduler to reduce complexity.

Given that the test accuracy is high, we must be cautious about overfitting while adjusting learning_rate and weight_decay. The client's last learning rate was set at 0.001, but looking at the overall task guidance, a decrease in this value might help refine model generalization, so I recommend reducing it to 0.0005. I will also increase weight_decay to 0.001 to further enhance regularization, given the potential for overfitting with such a high accuracy. The momentum can remain at 0.9, as it aligns well within the advised limits. As for the optimizer, I will continue using 'SGD', as it is often effective for image classification tasks like this and was previously successful. The local_epochs will stay at 2, as this strikes a balance between learning and resource use for medium-capacity clients. I will also shift the batch_size to 64, providing a good compromise between processing efficiency and training stability, which will help the model learn better with less overfitting risk due to the larger mini-batch size. The dropout_rate can safely be increased to 0.3 from 0.2 to enhance generalization further. For the server parameters, I will match the client's choices wherever applicable. This leads to the server's learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 with the 'SGD' optimizer, as these provide a solid baseline for synchronization. I will set the server scheduler to 'None,' consistent with its previous setting, suggesting that such adjustments might not add value.

However, given the task of image classification on CIFAR-10 with moderate client capacity, and in light of the need for potential adjustment, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0005, which is still within the allowed range but slightly conservative. This will help avoid any overfitting while ensuring effective training. For weight decay, I suggest setting it to 0.0005 to provide a balance between avoiding overfitting and allowing the model to learn adequately, staying comfortably within the accepted range. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to maintain stability in gradient updates, which has been effective historically. The choice of optimizer will stay with 'AdamW', as it has worked well previously. I am keeping the local_epochs at 2, as lowering it excessively may hinder learning in a medium-resource environment. The batch size will be set at 32, the only smaller option allowed, to better suit the medium resource while balancing learning stability. Lastly, I'll increase the dropout rate to 0.3 from 0.1 to help combat potential overfitting observed in previous attempts. For the server parameters, I will also set the learning rate to 0.001 to coordinate effectively with the client's learning adjustments and keep the momentum and optimizer consistent. The scheduler will be kept as 'None' to avoid complications in learning rate scheduling since no positive impact has been previously noted. The mu parameter will be set at 0.01, retaining a balance to control the FedProx regularization effectively.",

The weight decay is set to 1e-05 to provide a slight regularization effect without being overly restrictive, which is essential since the client's previous data is not available yet. The momentum value of 0.9 is on the higher end, which helps in maintaining velocity during optimization, critical for deep learning models. 'AdamW' is selected as the optimizer because it is popular for image classification tasks due to its adaptive learning feature, which helps accelerate training. The scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow the learning rate to decrease and adapt over time, improving convergence particularly in early training stages. A local epoch count of 2 is proposed since it allows some updates without overfitting given the medium resources. A batch size of 64 is chosen, striking a balance between training speed and convergence stability. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.2 is included to combat overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. On the server side, the parameters mirror the client settings to facilitate consistent learning across nodes.

Since the task is an image classification with potential risks of overfitting (high training accuracy vs. moderate test accuracy), I will suggest a slightly different set of hyperparameters. Keeping the learning rate low (0.0005) will help further in preventing overfitting while still allowing for robust training, as this value is still effective in the range that had been successful previously. For weight_decay, I will increase it slightly to 0.0005 to fight overfitting further. The momentum remains at 0.9, which has been effective, and I will retain the 'AdamW' optimizer as opposed to switching to SGD which may reduce performance. The dropout_rate will increase to 0.3 to add more regularization during training. Following the client's capacity of a medium-resource cluster, I will keep local_epochs at 2 (which is optimal between 1 and 3), and I will opt for a batch_size of 32 as it has been effective with previous configurations. For the server, I will use the same learning rate (0.001), momentum (0.9), and the 'AdamW' optimizer to ensure consistency in training and model convergence. The scheduler will stay as 'None' for simplicity, as complex scheduling isn't necessary at this point. Lastly, I will set mu at 0.01 to maintain the federated learning scheme effectively without being overly conservative or aggressive.",

Given the overall context and the medium-resource capabilities of the client, I recommend a slightly reduced learning rate of 0.0005 to refine the learning process without risking instability. The current weight decay of 0.0001 is sufficient for regularization but could be increased to 0.0005 to help prevent potential overfitting further if necessary. The momentum is set at 0.9, which is optimal for stabilizing the training. I recommend switching from 'Adam' to 'AdamW' as the optimizer to incorporate weight decay directly into the optimization process, which could lead to better results with ResNet. The batch size of 32 is slightly larger than allowed; therefore, I suggest dropping to the nearest valid size of 24, which aligns with the client's medium-resource classification. The dropout rate of 0.3 suggests a balanced approach to regularization, but increasing it slightly up to 0.4 might help reduce overfitting if necessary, especially with the increased batch size. On the server side, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 works well, and keeping the same momentum and optimizer (Adam) is consistent across both sides. The mu value of 0.01 is appropriate for FedProx regularization, helping to balance between local and global updates effectively.",

The last two test accuracies (72.65% and 80.69%) indicate that weight decay may still be on the lower side, exemplifying that some regularization could help improve the model further. I suggest increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 to introduce a moderate amount of regularization. The model's performance history suggests stability with a momentum of 0.9, which I will retain. The 'Adam' optimizer has shown favorable results previously, so I will continue with it. The batch size was previously at 32; however, given medium resource constraints, I will adjust this down to 24. Considering the dropout rate was set to 0.2 before and achieved reasonable results, I will retain it as it presents a balance between regularization and learning capacity. For the server parameters, maintaining a learning rate of 0.0005 and a 0.9 momentum appears optimal based on performance trends. I will set 'None' for the scheduler, aligning with previous setups.

I'll set the learning rate to 0.0025. The weight decay is currently low at 0.0001, which is not providing sufficient regularization; therefore, I will increase it to 0.0005 to combat potential overfitting and achieve a better balance between training and test accuracy. The momentum, which has been stable in the past, will remain at the default value of 0.9. The chosen optimizer is still AdamW since it's been effective for clients with similar setups. Regarding the batch size, I will select 256 as it provides a larger sample size per update, which should help stabilize training given the client\u2019s high resource capacity. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.25 for better regularization, up from the past 0.15, as this should help mitigate overfitting further. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 for stability as that has yielded consistency in test performances in the past, with AdamW remaining the optimizer of choice for its effectiveness. No scheduler is needed at this point since stability has been achieved without one. The value of mu will be set to 0.01 as it allows for a moderate level of regularization in the federated learning context, based on previous analyses.

The weight decay is set at 1e-06, which is minimal but helps with overfitting if necessary. For momentum, I selected 0.9, which has been a common value for SGD optimizers in past practices, balancing speed and stability. The optimizer is set to 'SGD', consistent with peer 276's choice that performed well. The local epochs are set to 2, allowing sufficient training time while not overwhelming the low-resource client. I selected a batch size of 16, which is manageable for the client\u2019s capacity. Finally, I chose a dropout rate of 0.2, which aids in mitigating overfitting while fitting within the constraints.

Client 276's successful choice included a low learning rate of 0.0003, which is effective for a low-resource client like this one. Thus, I'll set 'learning_rate' to 0.0003, which aligns with the need for stability. For 'weight_decay', I will set it to 1e-06, as a minimal regularization is suitable for image classification tasks in this context, especially given no prior evidence of overfitting or underfitting from this client. The 'momentum' will be set to 0.9, which is a standard choice for SGD optimizers, ensuring a good balance of updating direction in gradient descent. The 'optimizer' will also be set to 'SGD', which is currently preferred in peer success cases. The 'scheduler' will be set to 'None' as the peer strategy did not include it, and this will maintain simplicity. For 'local_epochs', I will use 2, an intermediate value that allows enough gradients to stabilize without overwhelming the low-resource capability of the client. The 'batch_size' will be set to 16 to keep the computations manageable, a value chosen by peer 276. Lastly, I recommend a 'dropout_rate' of 0.2 to mitigate potential overfitting while still maintaining enough representational capacity. For the server, I will mirror the client's learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, using the 'SGD' optimizer. The 'scheduler' will also be set to 'None' for consistency. The mu value is set to 0.01, a moderate choice that fits centrally within the acceptable range.",

Given client 205's slightly lower accuracy with a learning rate of 0.0001, it's clear that going lower might risk underfitting. I will then set the learning rate to the maximum allowable within the constraints, which is 0.0001, as it may support further convergence while ensuring more consistent updates. I will also set weight_decay to 0.0001, as it was effective in past trials to mitigate overfitting risks, especially given that the accuracy was quite high relative to the potential for overfitting. The momentum will remain at the standard 0.9, which has been consistently used successfully by the client and peers. The optimizer will stay as SGD, which is currently used, and no changes to the scheduler is needed since 'StepLR' is appropriate for this scenario. Local epochs will remain at 2 based on prior usage, and the batch size at 32 is consistent with medium-resource clients while also fitting the previous context. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.4 is suitable as it effectively helps balance overfitting without reducing the model\u2019s capacity excessively. For the server-side, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, as this has proven effective. The optimizer remains as SGD providing stability in updates across clients.

However, to combat possible overfitting (with the test accuracy being lower than the client's own training trends), I will suggest increasing the weight_decay to 0.0005, which is still within the constraints and aligns with effective regularization for CNN models. The dropout rate can also be increased to 0.5 to further address potential overfitting. The batch size of 32 is reasonable considering the medium-resource client classification, and I will keep it consistent since it has shown success without causing underutilization of resources. For server-side parameters, we will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 and the SGD optimizer, which is tested and effective in prior sessions. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to ensure stability and responsiveness during training.

Since last round's analysis applied action(s) to refine the search space, I'll maintain the dropout rate of 0.4 as it has remained stable without signs of overfitting. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0002 to enhance regularization as test accuracy increases, which can help tackle any potential overfitting, especially given that the earlier tests showed a sign of overfitting when the learning rate was higher. Considering the guidance for high performance, I will reduce the learning rate slightly to 0.00015, which is in between the preceding values and provides a middle ground for further optimization. The optimizer will be kept as 'AdamW,' which has previously helped in stabilizing training. For the server, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is advisable since it was part of a stable configuration across clients yielding good results. I will also maintain 'SGD' as the optimizer to ensure consistency with peer parameters and use 'StepLR' for the scheduler for learning rate adjustments over epochs. Finally, I will slightly increase 'mu' to 0.06 to offer more robust regularization through FedProx as we saw in previous rounds.

The `weight_decay` has also varied, but a slightly higher value (0.0003) could help mitigate overfitting observed in the recent epochs. The choice of `momentum` remains at 0.9, as it has proven effective in the past. The optimizer `AdamW` has been stable; thus, it will remain. Since previous configurations did not fully utilize the batch size options, upping the `batch_size` to 32 makes sense for more accelerated convergence with available resources. The dropout rate is increased to 0.3 to help with regularization, given that it\u2019s on the cusp of helping with high training representativeness. For the server parameters, maintaining all values is sound since they are within optimal ranges that supported previous clients; hence they will remain unchanged with a low `learning_rate` of 0.001 and `mu` set to 0.01 for regularization as it has shown to stabilize the federated training process effectively."

The previous weight decay of 0.0002 is acceptable as it helps with regularization; hence, I recommend keeping it the same. The momentum is stable at 0.9, which is a good choice for both convergence speed and quality. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' since it offers effective performance for deep networks like ResNet18. For dropout, I will use 0.4, as per peer 97's configuration, which may help mitigate overfitting by allowing greater flexibility in the learning process. The local epochs will remain at 2, given the low-resource constraints, which should allow for meaningful updates without overwhelming the clients. The batch size of 16 is selected because the client has performed well with this size in the past. The server learning rate of 0.001 remains unchanged to ensure consistency in the training process.

The server can also use the 'None' scheduler to maintain a straightforward approach. The mu parameter is set to 0.01 as it is a common choice for FedProx experiments, providing a moderate regularization influence without over-regularizing. Overall, these hyperparameter choices aim to optimize performance while adhering closely to the constraints and leveraging the client's historical successes.",

The client's history indicates the learning rates of 0.001 and 0.0005 provided moderate performance, with the latter achieving a better test accuracy. Therefore, retaining a `learning_rate` of 0.0005 is appropriate, as it is within the recommended range and previously yielded competitive results. Given the client's performance and the peer history mentions, especially Client 386 who had success with a `weight_decay` of 1e-05, I suggest decreasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0001 to slightly enhance regularization without pushing our constraints. The momentum remains at 0.9, consistent with successful configurations. The optimizer will switch to 'Adam' for better adaptability in low-resource environments based on its general effectiveness, as indicated by the peer history. I further suggest lowering `local_epochs` to 2 due to the low-resource capacity of the client. For `dropout_rate`, I will increase this to 0.4, given the performance improvements seen with approaches that incorporate dropout in similar configurations. For the server configuration, I'll maintain a `learning_rate` of 0.001 and an optimizer of 'Adam' for consistency with prior effective server configurations, ensuring that the `momentum` remains at 0.9. Finally, I will set `mu` to 0.01 to balance the FedProx regularization, based on prior successful setups and guidance."

To address dropout, increasing to 0.4 from 0.3 may help combat any overfitting without straying from the 0.0 to 0.5 range. The momentum remains at 0.9 for stability, and Adam as an optimizer is retained since it has been used effectively before. The local epochs are kept at 2, which is a moderate setting, and the batch size remains at 32 as used historically. For the server parameters, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 to ensure that the global model does not accelerate too quickly and cause instability while keeping momentum at 0.9 for consistency.

The weight_decay is set to 1e-04; this is a small increase for regularization that aligns with the guidance in addressing potential overfitting without being over aggressive. A momentum value of 0.9 will help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, leading to faster convergence. I will choose 'AdamW' as the optimizer since it generally performs well across varied tasks and especially with large models like ResNet18 on image data. I will apply 'CosineAnnealingLR' for scheduling to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training. I set local_epochs to 3 to allow ample training on the local data and a batch_size of 64, which is manageable given the client's high resource capacity but large enough to give stable gradient updates. The dropout_rate of 0.2 is a moderate choice to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. On the server side, I will apply the same learning_rate of 0.001 and optimizer 'AdamW' to maintain consistency between the client and server, essential in federated learning setups. The momentum will also be set at 0.9, aligning with best practices for optimization. A scheduler of 'StepLR' will be chosen to provide a predictable decay schedule to the learning rate over time, enhancing stability.

As the test accuracy only slightly improved from Epoch 28 to Epoch 32 while using lower learning rates, this indicates potential underfitting. To combat this, I recommend increasing the learning rate slightly closer to the upper constraint to potentially improve performance. The recent experimentation showed that a learning rate of 0.0003 previously yielded a test accuracy of 78.39%, so I will set it to a slightly higher value within constraints. The weight decay is set higher than the previous value to try to prevent overfitting given the relatively stable train/test accuracies. The client has been using a dropout rate of 0.3 which is moderate; maintaining it allows for some regularization without being too aggressive. The batch size of 16 is more manageable for the client's moderate resources and could help in faster convergence. For the server hyperparameters, the learning rate is kept constant as previously utilized, and the optimizer remains 'AdamW' to match the client\u2019s setting for compatibility, and 'None' for scheduler maintains stability without introducing additional complexity. The mu parameter is set at 0.01 as it has been effective, balancing the FedProx regularization without being too conservative. Overall, the adjustment of the learning rate along with the weight decay aims to enhance learning while addressing any underfitting concerns."

In epochs 18 and 32, while the model reached a test accuracy of 82.47%, it dropped to 80.73%, indicating potential overfitting as the training accuracy remained high. Considering the guidance for image models, we should increase the `weight_decay` to help regulate overly complex models. The previous `learning_rate` of 0.001 is acceptable for a powerful client, but since there are signs of overfitting, I will leave the `learning_rate` the same for now. The `dropout_rate` was increased to 0.25 and provided better results in epoch 32, so I will set it to 0.3 to further explore regularization. Given the availability of resources, I suggest using a larger `batch_size` of 256 to speed up training and a conservative `local_epochs` of 2. I'm keeping the optimizer as 'SGD' with momentum set to 0.9, which has been effective in the previous epochs. For the server, I retain the same parameters since more stable performance is needed in communication and I will keep `mu` at 0.01, which has been part of the recent successful configurations. Overall, these adjustments will aim to enhance accuracy and mitigate overfitting based on observed performance trends.",

The weight decay of 0.0007 is already low, thus keeping it unchanged helps regularize without imposing too much restriction on learning. The momentum of 0.9 is retained as it's a common choice and should work well with the AdamW optimizer, which I will also keep because it's generally effective for image classification tasks. The batch size remains at 16 since we are constrained to low-resource clients and this size was effective in their previous configurations. The dropout rate will also remain at 0.4 since it suggests that overfitting is managed well at this level. On the server side, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0005 from 0.001, allowing for more controlled updates during the federated training process, while retaining the original settings for momentum and optimizer. Lastly, I will keep mu at 0.01 as previous analyses indicate no issues with this regularization strength.

However, looking at peer history, Client 467 successfully trained with a low learning_rate of 0.0004, which I will adopt for our client to ensure stable training given their low-resource capacity. A weight_decay of 0.0007 was effective, so I will set it slightly higher at 0.0008 to provide additional regularization, as this can help prevent overfitting when fewer training resources are available. The momentum will be set at 0.9, consistent with the peer\u2019s successful configuration, and the optimizer will be AdamW, known for better performance with image data. The learning rate and weight decay are chosen based on the constraints provided to ensure the model doesn't converge too fast due to resource limitations. For the local_epochs, I will choose 2 based on peer history's successful use to allow sufficient training without overwhelming the client resources. Regarding batch_size, I will set it to 16, the same as the peer, to strike a balance between computational load and gradient approximation. A dropout_rate of 0.4 is reasonable and aligns with peer data that showed success in controlling overfitting. For the server parameters, I also choose a learning_rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, and AdamW optimizer, similar to the client setup, ensuring that both models are aligned in their optimization strategies. Finally, a mu value of 0.01 is chosen, which is similar to peer uses and helps regulate the FedProx constraint effectively under the SplitFed framework.",

Therefore, I will suggest a higher learning rate of 0.0005, which is still acceptable according to the constraints. Since the previous test accuracy was quite close to 80% but has fluctuated, indicating possible minor overfitting issues, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 for better regularization. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3 from 0.2 as it previously seemed helpful. The batch size will be kept at 16 to maintain consistency with the last successful run. Lastly, local_epochs will remain at 2 for balance between training time and convergence ability. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001, as it is within the acceptable range and is a sound choice based on the peer consistency. The optimizer will also remain 'AdamW', and the scheduler will be 'CosineAnnealingLR', which has proven effective in prior experiments.

Given that the learning rate was set to 0.01 and still produced decent results, scaling it down to 0.005 could promote better convergence without risking underfitting, especially given the high capacity of the client. Increasing the weight decay slightly to 0.0005 will help combat potential overfitting, given that the model might still be getting too complacent in its training. Maintaining a momentum of 0.9 aligns with common practices for optimization stability. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW' to leverage adaptive learning rates. Since the batch size of 64 has been previously used without issues, it will be retained, alongside a local epoch of 2 to provide a balanced approach between training duration and resource management. The dropout rate is adjusted upwards to 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting risk, aiming for improved generalization. On the server side, keeping the learning rate at 0.005 encourages robust client updates, while using 'AdamW' helps maintain optimization efficiency. The momentum remains at 0.9 for stability. A 'None' scheduler is chosen since it allows for consistent updates without additional complexity.

A `dropout_rate` of 0.2 is set to introduce some regularization without excessively sacrificing model capacity.

To strike a balance between learning stability and convergence speed, I've selected a moderate learning_rate of 0.001. This is within the provided constraints and is a common starting point for training deep networks, especially on datasets like CIFAR10. A weight_decay of 0.0005 is chosen to help mitigate any potential overfitting, as this dataset can lead to complex models that easily memorize training examples. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is a common choice to accelerate convergence and is known to work well for SGD optimizers. AdamW is selected as the optimizer for its adaptive learning capabilities and effectiveness with image data. Staying cautious due to the client's first training round, a local_epochs count of 2 allows reasonable training iterations without over-consuming resources. The batch size of 64 is optimal for the client's high-resource capacity, balancing training speed and gradient update stability. A dropout_rate of 0.3 is included to provide regularization without excessively constraining learning capacity, addressing the risk of overfitting from the high capacity of the ResNet18 model. For the server settings, I've mirrored the client's learning_rate and momentum to maintain consistency across training, choosing AdamW again for its advantages in converging training processes with similar datasets. The mu value is set at 0.01, ensuring adequate FedProx regularization without overly constraining the local models.

The weight decay will remain at 0.0001 to balance regularization while avoiding excessive shrinkage that could compromise learning. With respect to the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0001 in line with the client's stabilized performance, using an 'Adam' optimizer to facilitate stable convergence.

The latest configuration of a learning_rate at 0.0001 yielded a test accuracy of 82.85%, suggesting that increasing the learning rate significantly might lead to underfitting problems due to low exploration of the parameter space. Therefore, I will keep the learning rate low at 5e-05 for stability. The weight_decay value of 5e-05 is reasonable, but I will increase it to 0.0001 to enforce more regularization and mitigate potential overfitting. The use of SGD has been consistent in previous runs, and I will maintain this optimizer choice while keeping momentum at 0.9. The dropout_rate of 0.3 was applied recently; I will slightly increase it to 0.4 to combat overfitting further. Given the client\u2019s low-resource capacity, I will keep the batch_size at 16, as it has been stable in past configurations. I will also maintain local_epochs at 2 to balance training time and model convergence. For the server, since the last used learning_rate was 0.001 and effective, I will keep it the same while also using SGD and 0.9 momentum.

Thus, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to 5e-05 to help combat overfitting while keeping the learning rate fixed. The dropout rate will also be slightly increased to 0.4 based on peer experiences. Using the SGD optimizer remains optimal as shown in previous results. As for local_epochs and batch_size, I will retain them at 2 and 16 respectively, which appear to be stable. For the server parameters, the learning rate remains at 0.001, given its past effectiveness. I will also keep the momentum at 0.9 and continue with the 'SGD' optimizer since it has been stable, maintaining 'None' for the scheduler for simplicity in this low-resource context.

Therefore, I will recommend reducing the learning rate slightly to 0.0004 to help with overfitting. The weight decay remains at 0.0002 for regularization as there is no indication of severe overfitting to necessitate an increase. The optimizer choice remains 'AdamW' as it has been effective. The dropout rate of 0.4 is also maintained, as it likely contributes positively to model generalization without causing underfitting. The local epochs are kept at 2, and the batch size is 32, which is adjusted to the only permissible option of 24, as the constraints specify this without compromising on resource capabilities. For the server configuration, I will keep the server learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 (consistent with the client settings). I will use 'AdamW' again, as it has shown reliability, and no scheduler is needed. A mu value of 0.01 is chosen as it aligns with past configurations without causing instability.",

Let's analyze the hyperparameter choices. The previous learning rate of 0.001 was relatively conservative, and the achieved test accuracy suggests that there may be room for improvement. Given the client's high-resource capacity, I will opt for a slightly higher batch size of 128, which can help in stabilizing training. As per the expert guidance, if the model exhibits signs of overfitting (high train accuracy, low test accuracy), I will maintain a low weight decay to prevent over-regularization, but increase it slightly to 0.0002 to strike a balance. The optimizer will stay as AdamW, which has been effective. I recommend a learning rate of 0.0005, on the upper end of the constraint, to encourage faster convergence while fitting within the recommended range. The momentum will remain at 0.9 to support the adaptation of the learning process. A dropout rate of 0.3 will introduce more regularization to help prevent overfitting, leveraging the flexibility of the high-resource client infrastructure. Server-side, I will match the learning rate to the client's at 0.0005, leverage the same momentum of 0.9, and use the 'AdamW' optimizer to maintain consistency across client and server. The mu parameter will be set to 0.01 to ensure effective control in the federated scheme.",

To mitigate overfitting, according to the guidelines, I will adjust the learning_rate to lower values (while adhering to constraints) and keep weight_decay in check with a slight increase to improve regularization. Given that the weight_decay is already at its minimal level, I will increase it to 0.0002 within the constraint. Increasing the dropout_rate to 0.4 helps prevent overfitting as well. The batch_size can be set to 32, which was previously successful for the client and remains moderate for a cluster 1 client. The local_epochs can be set to 2.0 to maintain a balance as it has been previously used. The chosen server learning_rate stays at 0.001, as it has demonstrated considerable effectiveness across peers.

This suggests potential for enhancement, particularly looking at the peer (Client 196) who achieved better performance. The peer used a slightly lower learning rate (0.0005) with SGD, indicating that a conservative adjustment could be beneficial. Therefore, I propose to decrease the learning rate to 0.0005 to potentially enhance learning stability. I will also increase the weight_decay to 0.0006 to combat any overfitting observed previously. The batch size is set to 256 to align with high-resource capabilities while being responsive to accuracy improvements. For the dropout rate, I will modestly raise it to 0.3 to promote better generalization without causing significant information loss. The server parameters will remain consistent with the previous successful runs, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 and using Adam for optimization, as it was beneficial previously, while keeping mu at 0.01 to maintain regularization strength.",

The weight decay will be set to 0.0001, which is towards the lower limit, hence manageable for this client. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it aligns with historical settings and is optimal for training stability. The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen because it has been consistent in their previous configurations. I will maintain the local epochs at 2 to keep the training time reasonable. The batch size remains at 16, which has been effective in the past. I also increase the dropout rate to 0.4 to potentially mitigate any overfitting that might be present given the test accuracy. For the server, I will set the learning rate at 0.0003, a slight increase from the previous settings allowing a better generalization between the clients, while maintaining the same momentum, optimizer, and scheduler.

Peer client 85 achieved a high accuracy (80.99%) with a learning rate of 0.0005, which is within the range of options and suitable for low-resource clients. Therefore, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005 to maintain stability. Their weight decay of 0.0005 is also recommended for regularization, helping to prevent overfitting in potentially low training data contexts, so I will choose that as well. The momentum from both peers is consistent at 0.9, which provides some stability in SGD updates, so I will adopt that. The optimizer used by peers is Adam, which is well-suited for image classification tasks and will be the one I select. I will implement a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler, as seen in peer 85's approach, which could help adjust learning rates dynamically. Given the client's lower resource constraints, I will opt for a batch size of 16 and local epochs of 2. Additionally, I choose a dropout rate of 0.3 since it has been commonly used by peers to mitigate overfitting risk while preserving generalization capability. For the server, I will maintain the same learning rate (0.0005) and momentum (0.9) as the client. The optimizer will also be Adam for consistency.

I will keep the local epochs at 2 for stability in low-resource settings and choose a batch size of 16 for reasonable performance. The dropout rate will stay at 0.3, as it provides a good regularization balance without causing overfitting. For the server parameters, I will use the same `learning_rate` of 0.0003 for consistency and effective training across the client-server framework while maintaining momentum at 0.9.

The provided guidance suggests that if there are discrepancies between training and test accuracy, we may need to tweak hyperparameters to address overfitting or underfitting. Given the current learning rate is at the high end of the client's constraints, and since our analysis indicates that the test performance may need optimization, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0005 to potentially enhance generalization. The weight_decay will be increased slightly to 0.0005 to help with regularization, which seems warranted due to the previous performance metrics. The dropout_rate will be increased to 0.3 from 0.25 to further combat any signs of overfitting indicated by a 5% differential between training and test accuracy. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' to leverage momentum effectively and the local_epochs will be set to the maximum of 3 for thorough training, while the batch_size will be kept at 32 for optimal performance. On the server side, I recommend maintaining the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, leveraging the stable performance observed before. The mu parameter will also be kept at 0.01, as this has been working effectively in the federated setup.",

For weight_decay, I will use 1e-04 to add regularization without being overly aggressive. I will choose the AdamW optimizer due to its adaptive learning rates, which can be beneficial when working with this kind of image data. The scheduler will be 'StepLR' to allow a gradual learning rate decay over epochs, providing a better convergence rate. I will set local_epochs to 3 and batch_size to 32, as it is a good balance for medium-resource clients. For dropout_rate, I'll set it at 0.2, which helps prevent overfitting without diminishing model capacity. For the server parameters, I will also set learning_rate to 0.001, keeping the momentum at 0.9, and will still choose 'AdamW' for its adaptive advantage. The scheduler for the server will be 'None'.

The weight decay will be slightly increased to 0.0006 to help with regularization, particularly in cases where the model might be prone to overfitting.

The weight decay will remain at 0.0005 since it's well within range and is not overly aggressive, which would help balance regularization without overdamping the model learning. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is consistent with previous settings and supports effective training dynamics. The choice of optimizer stays with 'AdamW' to benefit from its adaptive learning rate properties. The local epochs will remain at 2, balancing training time and convergence. The batch size will be increased to 128 due to the high-resource capabilities, allowing for better gradient estimation. I will also increase the dropout rate to 0.3, easing the overfitting concern that might arise as we increase the learning rate. For server parameters, the same settings will be adopted, ensuring consistency and stability in the federated scheme.

The weight decay will be set to 1e-05, as it is already in a suitable range for regularization, but we might consider increasing it if we observe overfitting during training. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as per the established good practices without any adverse effects reported. The optimizer will also stay as 'AdamW', which has been effective. The batch size will be set to 16, which is manageable for low-resources. I\u2019ll increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to help further mitigate overfitting, allowing a more robust training for the model. For the server parameters, I will maintain the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, using 'AdamW' for continuity and stability. The server does not need such a stringent reduction for this iteration, thus I'll keep the scheduler as 'None' to maintain simplicity.

A weight decay of 0.0001 is sufficient for this group's regularization needs, while a momentum of 0.9 provides some inertia without being too aggressive. The Adam optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning capabilities, particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios. A local_epochs value of 2 provides a balance between training time and performance enhancement. A batch size of 16 is manageable for the client's limited capabilities. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 strikes a balance between reducing overfitting and maintaining enough model capacity to learn effectively. For the server, similar principles apply with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 using the Adam optimizer to ensure consistent aggregation of model updates.

For `weight_decay`, I settled on 0.0001 to provide a slight regularization effect without being too aggressive, which could impair learning; this value is at the lower end to encourage learning while still providing overhead for regularization. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that helps in stabilizing the velocity of descent in optimization. I opted for the `AdamW` optimizer since it generally offers better performance on image data compared to SGD, allowing for efficient weight updates. The `scheduler` is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually decrease the learning rate over epochs, aiding in convergence. I suggested a `local_epochs` value of 2, balancing the need for sufficient local learning while being efficient, and a `batch_size` of 16, small enough to suit the low-resource capability without sacrificing too much learning stability. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2, which should help mitigate potential overfitting on the low-resources immediately and avoid an overly aggressive regularization that could hinder learning. On the server side, I chose the same `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and `optimizer` as the client to maintain consistency, and set the `scheduler` to 'None' to avoid additional complexity given there are no previous rounds to learn from.

              "reasoning": "The client previously used a learning rate of 0.0005, which performed well with a test accuracy of 79.19%. To optimize further based on the guidance for stable training on low-resource clusters, I have adjusted the learning rate to 0.0003, which is closer to the upper limit of the allowed range for this client but is still conservative enough given the constraints. This adjustment aims to improve convergence without risking significant instability. The weight decay has been set to 0.0001 to maintain regularization benefits without excessively penalizing the model weights. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as this has been effective in previous contexts. I selected the 'AdamW' optimizer because it combines adaptive learning with weight decay regularization, which is beneficial considering the classification nature of the task. The scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' which can help in refining training towards the end of the epochs. The local_epochs remain at 2 for stability, and I have chosen a batch size of 16, which is consistent with the prior selection. The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting given the high previous accuracy. For the server parameters, I retained the learning rate at 0.0005 for consistency, which permits good updates while keeping a lid on fluctuations. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain performance. The optimizer and scheduler choices are consistent with those used in the client side, promoting harmonization in updates. The value for mu is set at 0.01 as it is well within the allowed range and can help maintain client participation balance in the SplitFed scheme. Overall, these adjustments target improving model training and potentially enhancing test accuracy while adhering strictly to the constraints."

Given the moderate resource of the client, I selected a `batch_size` of 32 which balances the number of data points processed without demanding too much memory. For `local_epochs`, I recommend 2 epochs to allow sufficient training without overloading a single round. Following the guidance for image classification, and considering no previous performance history to suggest a specific need for alteration based on overfitting/underfitting, a `learning_rate` of 0.001 is reasonable to start with, allowing for gradual updates during training. I selected the SGD optimizer as it's commonly robust in terms of convergence for such tasks, coupled with a `momentum` of 0.9 to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The `weight_decay` is set to 0.0001, which is low enough for initial exploration but provides some regularization to prevent overfitting. The `dropout_rate` of 0.2 strikes a balance to help mitigate overfitting by randomly setting 20% of the activations to zero during training. On the server side, I maintained parity with the selected optimizer and parameters. I set the server `learning_rate` also at 0.001 and used `momentum` of 0.9, as it aligns with the client's optimizer choice. The `scheduler` is left as 'None' to simplify initial deployment. Lastly, setting `mu` to 0.01 provides a moderate regularization effect via FedProx, allowing the client to explore while still maintaining some degree of control over divergence in a federated learning environment.",

The batch size will be set at 48 as it's the only valid choice that can yield better resource management for a medium-resource client. The number of local_epochs will remain at 3 as this has been the norm in the client's recent configurations, promoting thorough training.

The last achieved test accuracy was 81.55%, which indicates potential for further tuning. Given that the client has high resources, I will suggest a slightly more aggressive `learning_rate`. The previous settings showed effective performance but given that client 184 achieved higher accuracy with a higher `weight_decay` and a larger `dropout_rate`, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 0.0003 to improve regularization and optimize `dropout_rate` between the last settings and peer performance. The batch_size will be set to 256, ensuring it sits well within the high-resource capabilities without straying from the available options. For the server, I will maintain a balance with a `learning_rate` of 0.002 to improve server-side updates while remaining within constraints. Using `AdamW` for the server will provide better convergence rates, and I will set `mu` to 0.05 as this aligns with previous successful iterations while exploring slightly lower values for more stability in updates.",

The momentum has been consistent at 0.9 across iterations, which is a reasonable choice, so I will keep it the same. The optimizer used on previous successful trials shows consistency with SGD, thus I will retain that choice. Moreover, I will maintain the local_epochs at 2 and adjust the batch_size to 128 to leverage the client's high-resource capabilities, as this can lead to better converging behavior. The dropout_rate will be slightly adjusted to 0.35 for regularization while still ensuring enough capacity in the model. Looking at the server parameters, maintaining a server learning rate of 0.001 allows for steady convergence without risking instability.

The weight decay of 1e-05 reflects a conservative approach toward regularization, aiming to keep overfitting in check while respecting the upper limit of 0.0002 for weight decay. The momentum value of 0.9 is chosen to maintain consistency with the client's historical performance. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' for its adaptive learning properties. The drop-out rate is set to 0.4 as it has previously helped prevent overfitting, particularly needed for low-resource clients, and the batch size is decreased to 12 to accommodate limited computational resources. Local epochs will stay at 2, as this has provided a good balance between training duration and convergence speed. For the server, consistency is maintained with a learning rate of 0.00025 to ensure that the server and client are effectively synchronized. The rest of the server settings mirror the client's to ensure cohesive learning. The mu value remains at 0.01, which is already optimized for federated learning as per previous successful configurations. Overall, these choices account for previous performances, ensure compliance with the constraints, and maximize the chances of improved accuracy.",

Following the split-fed central model strategy and keeping in mind that this client is resource-constrained, I will select a lower learning rate to ensure stable training. I'll set the `learning_rate` to 0.0003, which is the same as those used by peers, thus keeping it conservative yet effective. The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0001, a common value that aids in regularization, especially useful when overfitting might be a concern. Given the low-resource nature of the client, I will choose a `batch_size` of 16 to balance memory consumption and convergence speed while ensuring that they can still handle the load. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 to allow sufficient training without overwhelming the clients. A `dropout_rate` of 0.4, used by peer clients, will help mitigate overfitting. Overall, these choices maintain the integrity of the training process while adapting to the client's constraints. For the server side, I will mirror Client 360's hyperparameters to ensure consistency in updates, using `learning_rate` of 0.0003, `momentum` of 0.9, `optimizer` set to 'AdamW', and setting the `scheduler` to 'None'.

The weight_decay is set to 1e-04 to maintain a focus on regularization which can help mitigate any potential overfitting. Momentum remains at 0.9, which has proven effective based on the history. The optimizer is kept as SGD, as it's consistent with previous settings that achieved good results. The batch_size is at 16 for stability on low-resource clients, and the dropout_rate is adjusted to 0.4 in line with improvements observed in previous runs. The local_epochs remain at 2, ensuring efficient training without the risk of overloading the capacity of low-resource clients. On the server side, I am retaining the server learning_rate at 0.001 which is effective and within limits. Momentum is untouched at 0.9 as it aligns with successful setups.

The previous learning rate of 0.0003 is outside the constrained range, therefore we'll select a learning rate of 0.0002, which is still relatively high but ensures stability during training. The weight decay will be set to 0.0001 to help prevent any overfitting, while it's within the allowed range and has been effective in past attempts. The momentum will remain at 0.9, as seen in peer clients, which has not negatively impacted their performance. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' since it has shown promising results. The dropout rate will stay at 0.4, balancing the expressiveness of the model with a need to combat overfitting. The local epochs will remain at 2, allowing multiple passes over the local data without putting too much strain on resources. The batch size is retained at 16 due to client constraints and past usage, which aligns with the low-resource requirement. For the server, keeping the learning rate at 0.0003 from previous configurations seems effective and not exceeding past performance. Thus, I will use a value of 0.0002, which is within the allowed range and maintains performance. The momentum at 0.9 is kept in line with peer results. The optimizer will also be 'AdamW'. I will set the scheduler to 'None' as it seems to be working well for the clients based on past performance, and the global mu will remain at 0.01, consistent with typical usages in federated settings, allowing control over local updates without overly penalizing divergence."

The previous hyperparameters indicated a potential overfitting scenario between Epoch 30 (82.93%) and Epoch 37 (83.10%) as the learning rate was decreased, and the dropout rate was increased. To further improve this model, I will maintain a low `learning_rate` of 0.0005 to continue preventing overfitting, given the test accuracies showed reasonable performance with this setting. The `weight_decay` will be kept at 0.001 to help regularize the model and combat potential overfitting more effectively. The `momentum` will remain at 0.9, as it has provided stability in previous epochs. The `optimizer`, SGD, has consistently been selected in the past and will be kept instead of changing to AdamW or Adam to maintain consistency in the behavior of the model. Since batch sizes of 64 were used effectively in past rounds, the same will be kept, and the `local_epochs` will also remain at 2 to balance the training duration. Finally, the `dropout_rate` will be raised to 0.4 based on past observations that a higher dropout rate can help reduce overfitting while experimenting within the range. On the server side, I will continue with a `learning_rate` of 0.001, as this value is still within the optimal range for server updates. The server's `momentum` and `optimizer` will stay as previously set, ensuring a consistent learning environment. The `mu` will also be kept at 0.01 since it seems to balance the regularization applied by the FedProx method based on previous training performances.",

The most recent trials suggest that performance is improving even with the decreasing learning rates. In the last successful epoch, a learning rate of 0.00025 was used. The task requires the learning rate to be between 0.0001 and 0.0002. Therefore, I will select the maximum allowed learning rate of 0.0002 to maintain good gradients while adhering to the constraints. The weight decay has generally been gradually increased; I will edge it closer to the maximum permissible 0.001 to help mitigate overfitting tendencies, given the increased dropout rates toward end epochs. A momentum of 0.9 has shown consistent performance, and I will retain it. The use of AdamW optimizer has been beneficial, so I will keep it for both the client and server. The dropout rate has typically been adjusted upwards to 0.4; I will increment it to the upper limit of 0.5 to enhance regularization, given the increasing training capacity of the client. The batch size of 128 was previously successful but not allowed now, thus I will use 256 for enhanced batching on a high-resource client. A local_epoch of 2 is suitable and consistent with previous use. On the server's side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 for consistency and stability. The momentum (0.9) and optimizer type will remain unchanged. I will set the mu value at 0.01 based on previous consistency, situating it well within the allowed range.",

To pursue better performance while adhering to constraints, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.00025, which may help prevent overfitting and align with the underfitting guideline. The weight decay will be adjusted to 0.0007 for better regularization to possibly improve generalization. The dropout rate will remain at 0.4 as it didn't hinder the performance, while the batch size can stay at 128 to keep computational demands reasonable. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 since it's well within limits and an optimal setting based on the peer comparison. I will retain 'AdamW' as the optimizer and 'None' as the scheduler for server parameters since they have proved stable.

The momentum will remain at 0.9 to maintain stability in training. For the optimizer, I will stick with 'AdamW' as it has proven effective previously. I will retain the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler as it has been used successfully and allows for adaptive learning rate changes during training. Setting local_epochs to 2 provides a balance between training speed and convergence, as indicated by previous successes. Given the client\u2019s high-resource capacity, I will increase the batch_size to 256. Lastly, I will slightly increase the dropout_rate from 0.2 to 0.25 to improve regularization, as it is beneficial for mitigating overfitting. For the server side, I will mirror the learning_rate of 0.0004 to facilitate alignment, maintain the momentum at 0.9, and also employ the 'AdamW' optimizer with no scheduler, as simplistically reducing complexity can often aid in server-side performance without dynamic adjustments.

Following the guidance, since the client is in a low-resource environment, we want to prioritize stability and avoid high learning rates that could harm training performance. I will set the learning rate to 0.0001, the minimum value, to ensure stability while training on the client side. Since the previous weight decay value was 1e-05, I will keep it at the same level because it has not triggered overfitting issues yet, and it supports regularization without being overly aggressive on these limited resources. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' due to good performance with non-convex optimization landscapes typical in image classification tasks. The local epochs will be set to 2 to balance training duration and the number of updates. Considering the low-resource context, the batch size will remain at 16, as the previous configuration was stable. Lastly, the dropout rate is set to 0.3 to avoid overfitting while allowing the network to learn sufficiently. For the server, I suggest keeping the learning rate at 0.001 and using the same optimizer and momentum. The server's learning rate is still within the allowed range and supports effective global model updates. The scheduler will remain 'None' to prevent unnecessary complications. The value of `mu` will be set to 0.01 to provide a moderate level of FedProx regularization, optimizing for stability during training.",

The batch_size will stay at 16, which was previously used. The dropout_rate will be adjusted to 0.4 to help reduce overfitting as seen from previous trends, as higher dropout tends to help in lessening the disparity between train and test accuracies in situations where overfitting is a concern.

I selected a moderate learning rate of 0.001, which is within the limits for CIFAR10 image classification tasks, allowing for gradual convergence. For weight_decay, I chose 0.0001, a small value that favors learning without severe regularization since we don't have evidence of overfitting yet. A momentum of 0.9 is a well-known choice in deep learning as it effectively helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction while smoothing out the updates. I opted for the AdamW optimizer, which is suitable for image tasks due to its advantages in weight decay handling and adaptive learning rates. The learning rate scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to adaptively reduce the learning rate throughout training, which is helpful in optimizing convergence times. For local_epochs, I chose 2 as a balance between sufficient training and resource management, given the client\u2019s medium capacity. A batch size of 32 is further reflective of the medium-resource context to optimize training stability without overwhelming the client. The dropout_rate is set to 0.1 to prevent overfitting\u2014a typical approach for image classification tasks, including structural regularization. For the server, I mirrored the client's choices in learning rate and momentum, selecting AdamW as the optimizer for consistency between client and server, and set the scheduler to 'None' as we are focusing on the initial start without over-complicating things. Lastly, a mu value of 0.01 is moderate enough to ensure regularization without making it too dominant at the onset.",

Since last improvements came with higher weight_decay, I will set that at 0.0004 to help with potential overfitting from previous runs. Additionally, I will use Adam optimizer, as it has been consistently effective in prior configurations. Given the client's moderate resource level and the need to manage model complexity, I suggest a batch_size of 32, which has shown effectiveness in past configurations, alongside a local_epochs of 2 to maintain training efficiency without overloading resource capacity. The dropout_rate will be slightly higher than previous at 0.35 to further help regularization. For the server settings, maintaining the learning_rate at 0.0005 does not adhere to the constraints, so I will set it to 0.0003 for optimal performance while ensuring stability during updates. The momentum will stay at 0.9 and I will opt for the optimizer AdamW for continuity. The mu will stay at 0.01 for effective FedProx regularization based on recent peer performance metrics. The reasoning behind this configuration is to maintain a balance between performance optimization while adhering strictly to the given constraints."

Based on the task of fine-tuning the ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10, a slight reduction in learning rate might improve generalization, especially since both the client's and peer's recent results are clustered around 81-83% accuracy. Thus, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0012. The weight decay can stay at 0.0008, which appears to balance regularization without causing significant underfitting. The momentum of 0.9 is retained as it is commonly effective in such tasks. I'll keep the optimizer as 'AdamW', which is performant for image classification tasks. The batch size remains at 128 due to the client's high-resource capacity, and I will increase the dropout rate to 0.35 to potentially enhance generalization further, considering the evidence of overfitting. The server's parameters are kept consistent as the current settings are working well, with a learning rate of 0.001 and 'AdamW' optimizer.

The optimizer remains AdamW, which is a good choice for this type of task. The local epochs will be set to 2, matching previous successful rounds, and the batch size will remain at 16, as it balances between the low-resource constraint and performance. The dropout rate of 0.4 has also been shown to help reduce overfitting. On the server, I will opt for a learning rate of 0.0005 as it is working well according to the peer's results, which indicates it should provide adequate learning without causing instability.

Client 249 achieved a 77.03% accuracy with a learning rate of 0.0002, which performed well at low resource given the Cluster 0 designation for client 444. Hence, I will adopt a similar learning rate for stability. The weight decay used by peer 249 is moderate (0.0007), suggesting that it is beneficial for clients as it helps regularize the model, thus I will also adopt this. Additionally, with a momentum of 0.9, peer 249 exhibited reasonable settings for stability which I will replicate. As this client is low-resource, the batch size should be smaller; therefore, I will select a batch size of 16, similar to peer client's choice. A dropout rate of 0.4 from peer 249 aims to reduce overfitting without excessive resource consumption, making it an apt choice. For the server, matching the learning rate and momentum decisions made for the client makes sense to sustain consistent learning dynamics across both. Finally, I will set `mu` to 0.01 as it was effective in peer's federation and fits within the required range.",

To stabilize training and prevent performance decrease, I've selected 0.0002, the highest value allowed under the constraints.

The batch size will be 16, as it is the higher option available suited for the client's capacity, potentially allowing faster convergence. The dropout rate is maintained at 0.4, which has shown promise in reducing overfitting. On the server side, the learning rate is again set to the maximum allowed (0.0005) while maintaining a consistent 'AdamW' optimizer, as no peers indicated change to this.

Given that the previous settings included a learning rate of 0.001, we want to keep this modest approach, as increasing it beyond 0.0005 could lead to instability. I will choose a learning rate of 0.0005 to strike a balance between effectiveness and controllability. As for the weight decay, I will keep it at 0.0001 since there\u2019s no indication of overfitting; both accuracies need to be monitored closely, but no adjustment is needed at this point. The momentum is maintained at 0.9, which provides sufficient velocity for optimization while adhering to the constraints. The 'AdamW' optimizer is kept for its adaptive capabilities. The scheduler remains 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow for gradual learning rate decay, aiding convergence. For client configurations, I will choose a batch size of 64, as the client has a medium capacity and this can help improve stability during training. The number of local epochs is set to 2 because we want to balance training time with the risk of overfitting, and retaining a dropout rate of 0.2 seems reasonable as it has already been tested, balancing between risk of overfitting and model complexity. For the server settings, we will replicate the learning rate of 0.0005 with \u2018AdamW\u2019 to ensure that server-side training aligns with the client. The momentum is kept consistent at 0.9, and I suggest using 'None' for the scheduler as server parameters typically do not require fine-tuning at this stage. Finally, I will set mu at 0.01 to maintain a regularization effect on the federated learning dynamic while staying within the given constraints.",

For weight decay, I will use a value of 1e-04, which is a common practice to help mitigate potential overfitting while remaining within the constraint limits. A momentum of 0.9 is chosen as it is a standard setting for SGD and provides a good compromise between stability and speed of convergence.

I will use a local_epochs value of 2, balancing between sufficient learning and resource constraints. A batch size of 64 is optimal here, considering the client\u2019s medium resource capacity, allowing for better gradient estimates. I will set a dropout rate of 0.2 to help prevent overfitting without significantly hindering the model's capacity to learn important features. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client's learning rate and momentum settings for consistency, choosing AdamW for the same reasons. I will not set a scheduler, since it's the first round.

Since the test accuracy is relatively high, it doesn't indicate significant underfitting or overfitting, but it is beneficial to experiment within the allowed ranges while remaining cautious. I will slightly decrease the learning rate to 0.0005 to maintain a conservative approach, expecting potential improvements in generalization. Additionally, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005, which helps prevent overfitting as it constrains the weights, thereby enhancing model performance slightly. The current momentum of 0.9 remains optimal for stability during training. I suggest continuing with the 'AdamW' optimizer, as it has been successful previously. The learning schedule will remain the same with 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually reduce learning rates while training, enhancing convergence. Regarding local epochs, I will keep it at 2 as it balances training frequency without overburdening the medium-capacity client. The batch size is kept at 32 as per the previous setting. A slight boost to the dropout_rate to 0.3 can help prevent overfitting further. For the server, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 aligns with the historical settings and strikes a good balance without exceeding the constraints, while also using 'AdamW' and 'CosineAnnealingLR' for a consistent training paradigm. Finally, I set mu to 0.02, which is safely within the range and will assist with regularization.",

The choice of SGD as the optimizer aligns with the successful configuration previously used, and the momentum remains at 0.9, which has proven effective. Additionally, from the analysis of prior runs, increasing the dropout_rate to 0.2 would help to regularize the model. I will also increase the batch_size to 256 to leverage the client's high computational capacity, optimizing training at the higher end of the established constraints. Regarding the server parameters, I will keep the optimizer as AdamW, to maintain consistency as it has proven effective, and stick with the learning_rate of 0.001 to ensure proper coordination in the federated setup.

The weight decay of 0.0005 is reasonable but could be increased to provide better regularization, especially because historical patterns show that high learning rates without proper weight decay tend to lead to overfitting in other clients. Therefore, I will set it to 0.0007. I will keep the momentum at 0.9 as it has been consistent in prior configurations. The chosen optimizer will remain SGD since it's proven effective in past trials, and the scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' helps in controlling learning rate decay well. The local_epochs will remain at 2, which is in line with prior configurations, and the batch_size of 128 is optimal for the high-resource client. I will slightly increase the dropout_rate from 0.2 to 0.3 for better regularization given the potential for overfitting with the new learning rate and adjustments. For the server, maintaining its learning rate of 0.001 allows synchronization with the client, and keeping the optimizer as AdamW complements SGD on the client side, providing a balanced convergence strategy.

Since they are currently in a low-resource setting, I will continue this trend and choose a lower learning rate of 0.0002 for better stability while maintaining the `weight_decay` at 0.0005 to help combat overfitting. The dropout rate will be adjusted to 0.3, a middle ground to help with generalization without overly restricting the model since it previously performed well with a dropout of 0.4. Additionally, I will keep the `batch_size` at 16 as it has shown viability in prior tests. For the server, the learning rate will be set to 0.0005, which is higher, to facilitate effective global model fusion. Other values such as momentum and optimizer remain consistent to ensure stability in training, following the previous successful configuration.

The previous test accuracy of 66.34% indicates that while there has been improvement, there is still room for adjustment, particularly considering the previous learning rates and their impact on performance. Given the client's low-resource capacity, it's essential to keep the learning rate on the lower end to ensure stable training. Thus, a learning rate of 0.0003 is optimal within the allowed range. The weight decay will be set slightly higher at 0.0006 to increase regularization, helping to manage any potential overfitting. The momentum is consistent with historical values at 0.9. The optimizer will remain as AdamW since it has been used effectively before. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.4 to further combat overfitting, based on peer experience suggesting success with similar values. Maintaining a batch size of 16 is acceptable, and local epochs are set to 2 to balance training duration and resource constraints. For the server, I will keep the learning rate for the server at 0.001, which has been stable, along with the momentum and optimizer values unchanged, and the scheduler set to None for simplicity. The proximal term (mu) will remain at 0.01, ensuring aligned training with regularization.

The client's past history indicates that momentum of 0.9 provides a good balance of gradient updates, so I will keep it consistent. The optimizer should be SGD based on previous successful runs. The local_epochs are kept at 2, as it aligns with the observed successful runs and efficiently utilizes the resources. For batch size, 16 is used since higher values are not available. The dropout rate is increased to 0.4 as this has proven beneficial in the client's history without crossing the 0.5 threshold.

However, given the constraint of the learning rate needing to be between 0.0001 and 0.0002, I suggest moving the learning rate to the lower end (0.0001) to further refine the model's updates. Increasing the weight decay slightly to 0.0006 will help with regularization due to potential overfitting, as we want to ensure that the model generalizes well on test data. The dropout rate is also increased from 0.3 to 0.4 based on the peer's successful use of a dropout rate that helped improve their accuracy. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', which has shown good performance in the past. The batch size is set to 128 since the client has the capacity to handle larger sizes. A conservative choice of local epochs at 2 balances the requirement for accurate training with efficient computation. For the server, stability in performance indicates that maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is appropriate, while also keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' for consistency with the past setup. Lastly, I set mu to 0.01, which facilitates enough regularization without being overly restrictive, given the client\u2019s higher capacity in terms of computational resources.",

Therefore, I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0008 to provide better generalization. I note that drop out rates have varied; however, increasing it to 0.4 helped peers to achieve higher accuracy, I'm inclined to suggest this higher dropout rate as well. The batch size remains 512, which is optimal for high-resource clients, and local_epochs will stay at 2, ensuring balance in training without causing excessive load. For the server settings, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 since it hasn't caused issues as per the guidance.

Hence, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001. The previously used weight_decay of 0.0008 is effective, but to ensure better generalization, I will increase it slightly to 0.001, which aligns with the guidance on overfitting. The momentum is kept at 0.9, which has shown consistent performance. Given the performance of the model, I will maintain the AdamW optimizer due to its advanced capabilities in handling deeper networks like ResNet. The scheduler remains as CosineAnnealingLR to allow for adaptive learning rate adjustments effectively over epochs. Since the batch_size of 512 is not allowed within the constraints, I will use a regular size of 128 for high-resource clients, which should be manageable and helps in optimization. Finally, I will set the dropout_rate at 0.35, slightly increasing it for better regularization based on recent tests that improved when increased to 0.4. For the server-side, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.001, which is effective and within bounds, and use the same optimizer and scheduler as the client. mu will be set to 0.01 to align with previous norms while offering some level of regularization in the federated learning context.",

Given the peer history, particularly Client 396's success with a learning rate of 0.002 and higher weight decay (0.0008) resulting in better accuracy (83.07%), I will lower the learning rate to 0.001 for more stability while also increasing the weight decay to 0.0006 to mitigate potential overfitting. This balances out weight decay in the proposed configurations from history while keeping room for manipulation within the lower ranges. The momentum remains at 0.9 since it was previously effective, as well as keeping the optimizer as AdamW which has yielded reasonable results previously. I will maintain a dropout rate of 0.4 to ensure robustness against overfitting based on more effective client results. The batch size remains at 128 to maintain higher gradient updates, suitable for the high-resource client capabilities. For the server configurations, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001, similarly to Client 70's last stable performance, and maintain the momentum at 0.9 with AdamW optimizer for consistency.

However, while aiming for improvement and considering their own historical data, a slight adjustment in hyperparameters is warranted. I will decrease `learning_rate` closer to the minimum to potentially enhance convergence stability; the original was 0.001, and I am selecting 0.0005, which is still in the allowed range. To avoid overfitting issues hinted by the previous setups, I'll increase `weight_decay` to 0.0005. Since `momentum` was previously at 0.9, I will maintain this value, staying within the range. For the optimizer, I will use 'SGD' as it has performed well in previous training. The `batch_size` will be set to 16, as it complements the medium-resource capabilities while adhering to the given constraints. Additionally, I will opt for a lower `dropout_rate` at 0.3 to balance regularization and model capacity. For the server, similar parameters to last rounds are effective, yet I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 to maintain consistency, momentum at 0.9, and use 'SGD' for my optimization. A mu of 0.01 will continue to be an effective balance for FedProx regularization, providing moderate control over local updates.",

Given that there were indications of high weight decay (0.0005), it may provide regularization but could also be a cause of underfitting if pushed too high, considering the accuracy jumps. The client has also consistently used SGD as an optimizer, which is both effective and recommended. Therefore, I will suggest maintaining the learning rate at 0.0001, keeping the weight decay stable, and slightly increasing the local epochs to 3 for additional training time, combined with a batch size of 32 to enhance convergence. As for the server, the configuration remains stable with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, aligning with optimal values found in the overall performance. Lastly, I will retain the mu value at 0.01 for FedProx regularization, as it has shown effectiveness without causing distortions in performance.",

The weight_decay remains at the default value of 0.0005, abiding by the constraint and balancing with the learning rate for additional regularization benefits. The momentum will stay at 0.9, aligning with the successful metrics of peers and keeping the optimizer as SGD, which was effective before. The local_epochs will be set to 2, given that this has been consistent with success, and I will keep the batch_size at 32, as it's midpoint fitting for medium-resource clients. Lastly, I'll increase the dropout_rate slightly to 0.4 to provide additional regularization aiming to improve generalization. For server parameters, the learning rate is kept as 0.001, which is consistent with peer practices; the optimizer remains as SGD, and the scheduler is set to 'None' since experimenting with a scheduler has not positively impacted training so far. Lastly, for mu, I will keep it at 0.01 as per previous successful iterations and maintain conformity with peer strategies."

The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' due to consistency in performance with the current setup. The batch size can be increased to 256, as the client has high resources and has previously used this value successfully, while the dropout_rate can be increased to 0.4 to potentially improve generalization. For the server settings, I will also keep the learning rate at 0.004 as this has not been detrimental.

A significant gain was observed when modifying the learning rate and weight decay parameters. Since both the client and peer histories show that learning rates around 0.001 are effective, I will maintain this and suggest a slightly higher learning rate of 0.002 as this falls within the range that has been effective for peer-client experiences too. Weight decay values have been kept around 0.0005 to 0.0008, but the last successful model used a weight decay of 0.0005, which I will keep as a starting point to mitigate overfitting. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' as it has offered consistent performance across experiments. Regarding the dropout rate, with a successful value of 0.4 recently used, I will suggest increasing it to 0.5 to further combat overfitting due to the previous high training accuracy. The batch size of 64 is still reasonable for this high-capacity client, allowing effective learning without overwhelming the client's resources. Lastly, I will keep the server learning parameters consistent with the client to maintain cohesion. A mu value of 0.01 will be kept as it remains functional without hampering too much gain.

Therefore, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0025 while maintaining a higher weight decay of 0.0008 to further combat potential overfitting. Given the success of dropout rates of 0.4 in peer histories, I will keep this value while also increasing the batch size to 128 as the client capacity allows for larger sizes and this has shown success with other clients. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.005, which has shown stable results in conjunction with the optimizer settings, maintaining the optimizer as AdamW because it has consistently performed well across previous attempts. The server's momentum will also remain at 0.9 as it fits comfortably within the optimal range. Finally, I will keep the mu at 0.01, which has been effective in previous rounds.",

However, this is outside the allowed range for the current configuration, requiring a reassessment. To avoid underfitting and considering experimentation from peers, I have chosen a learning rate of 0.0002, which is the upper boundary of the constraint. This value is suggested to maintain a balance of effectiveness while complying with the limits. I'll increase the weight decay slightly to 0.0008 to help minimize potential overfitting, as the historical data shows a slight downward trend in the accuracy. The momentum will remain at 0.9, consistent with successful configurations and peers. The optimizer will be kept as 'AdamW' for its efficient handling of gradients and performance in similar tasks. For the scheduler, I will opt for 'None' based on prior configurations that yielded better results without a scheduling strategy. Given the Cluster 2 capacity, I will use a batch size of 128, which has shown successful results historically. Finally, the dropout rate remains at 0.4 due to its previous positive impact on performance. For the server, I'll mirror the effective strategy observed from peer 359, opting for a server learning rate of 0.001 to ensure consistency. The mu value will be set to 0.01, as it's a middle ground that offers effectiveness in federated learning schemes.

Additionally, the consistency in achieving better accuracy with AdamW suggests maintaining this optimizer for client training to maximize convergence. The weight_decay will be adjusted to 0.0009, which helps in regularization given the soft overfitting indications because of a slight decline in accuracy\u2014allowing for more robustness. The dropout_rate remains at 0.4, as this has previously shown effectiveness in improving test accuracy while maintaining local stability. Finally, for the server, we'll keep the learning rate at 0.001 as it is already effective, along with the same momentum and optimizer for consistency across rounds while controlling for regularization with mu set at 0.01, a value previously used successfully.

Given the guidance, this indicates potential overfitting, suggesting a lower learning rate could improve test performance while sustaining learning. Therefore, I'll set the learning_rate to 0.0005 to reduce the chance of overshooting in the optimization process. The weight_decay is currently 0.0001 and is below the allowed maximum. Increasing it to 0.0005 can help mitigate overfitting. The momentum will be retained at 0.9, a midpoint providing stability in optimization. I've opted for the SGD optimizer for its simplicity and effectiveness in training CNNs. For client-side dropout_rate, I will increase it to 0.3 to prevent overfitting further, as the previous value of 0.2 seemed ineffective and was below the halfway mark. The local_epochs will remain at 2, which is consistent and provides a balanced approach to training iterations without placing too much load on a medium-resource client. The batch_size will be set to 32 to facilitate quicker iterations and should be manageable within the client's capacity. For server-side parameters, I will use the same learning_rate of 0.001 with the momentum set at 0.9 to maintain coherence with the client's configuration. The optimizer will remain as SGD, and I will use 'None' for the scheduler to simplify adjustments without additional complexities. Finally, the mu parameter will stay at 0.01 to ensure regularization in the federated scheme is effective without being over-constraining.",

The dropout rate has shown improvement from 0.2 to 0.3; I'll keep it at 0.3 as it balances between retaining significant features and preventing overfitting. The batch size will remain at 32 due to the medium-resource cluster capacity. Additionally, since the client has not exhausted their capacity (local_epochs = 2.0), I will keep it the same. For the server parameters, the learning rate is kept at 0.001 and the optimizer at 'AdamW', aligning with previous configurations without causing any issues.

The last successful configuration used a learning rate of 0.0004, and since we need to adhere to the guidance for a lower learning rate (between 0.0001 and 0.0003), we will reduce it to 0.0003. The weight decay can be adjusted slightly higher to mitigate overfitting since the test accuracy did not significantly improve. The current weight decay of 0.0003 will be set to 0.0004 to see if it reduces overfitting. The dropout rate is currently at 0.4, which has shown effectiveness in the previous configuration (@79.90%), so we will keep it there to maintain the regularization effect. The batch size can be increased to 32, which aligns with previous experiments and ensures adequate learning. The parameters regarding optimizer and momentum remain stable given they have proven effective. The server-side will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 as it has been consistent with previous models, and the other server parameters will remain as is. The `mu` value will stay at 0.01 for consistency. Therefore, the proposed hyperparameters prioritize stability and incrementally improve upon previous configurations while adhering to all constraints.",

A dropout_rate of 0.4 is recommended to mitigate overfitting, as seen in Client 335's successful run. I will use a batch_size of 32, which aligns with client capacity and peer usage.

For the server-side hyperparameters, I will adopt a learning_rate of 0.001, which is commonly used among peers and seems effective for convergence. Momentum will also be set at 0.9, maintaining consistency with the client setup. The optimizer will remain AdamW, as this has been consistently observed in successful runs.

However, given the past struggles and the application of 3 actions to refine the search space in previous experiments with the client, I recommend a more aggressive approach. Since the test accuracy is hovering just below 83%, it indicates potential overfitting when the training accuracy is notably high. Based on this, I will opt for a lower learning rate of 0.0001 to refine the model weights more delicately. Additionally, I will maintain the weight decay at 0.001, which should provide regularization without being excessively strong. With respect to dropout, I've noted increases in dropout rates reaching 0.3 with no observable detriment to performance, thus I will boost it slightly to a maximum of 0.35 for better generalization. For the optimizer, 'SGD' has been consistently utilized with no explicit indication to shift; therefore, I will retain it. A batch size of 256 is suitable given the high-resource capacity of the client, ensuring effective gradient updates without overloading memory. Regarding server hyperparameters, maintaining the optimizer and learning rate is advantageous for consistency, so I will keep these unchanged. Finally, I will set mu to 0.01, which aligns with expectations based on previous successful configurations.",

Additionally, the learning rate was progressively reduced over the last few epochs and currently stands at 0.0002, which appears to optimize performance. Given the strict constraints, the learning rate should be lowered slightly to 0.00015 to further stabilize training while still aiming for a higher test accuracy. The weight decay can be kept at 0.0002 to balance regularization without overly restricting learning. The other hyperparameters including momentum (0.9), optimization method (AdamW), scheduler type (CosineAnnealingLR), local epochs (2), and batch size (16) will remain unchanged as they have performed well. For the server settings, a consistent learning rate of 0.001 and the same momentum and optimizer as the client will maintain alignment in the federated learning scenario.

Therefore, I will choose a learning rate of 0.0003, which is on the higher end of the allowed range but still conservative. Additionally, given the recent results, I will increase weight_decay to 0.0002 to help combat potential overfitting. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3 to further promote generalization while remaining within the allowed range. The batch size will be kept at 32 as it has been effective and only this value is viable here. The client will run for 2 local epochs, consistent with past effective settings. For the server parameters, the learning rate will remain at 0.001 as it is within the allowed range and effective for the peers. The optimizer remains AdamW to leverage its adaptive learning rate capability, and the scheduler continues as CosineAnnealingLR for similar reasons that it improves convergence behavior.

Analyzing the history reveals high learning rates potentially leading to instability, while a relatively conservative setup from peers suggests a different path. Therefore, I will reduce the learning rate to 0.0003 (still within the permissible range) to help train more steadily, given that peer 290 successfully achieved an accuracy of 75.49% with an even lower learning rate of 0.0003. I will keep the weight decay at 0.0001 for regularization as it matches the successful peers' configurations. The momentum remains 0.9, in line with both peer and client standards. 'AdamW' is chosen for the optimizer as it was effective in previous rounds. I will suggest increasing the dropout rate to 0.4, as it helps in controlling overfitting while matching successful configurations from peers. For local epochs, I will keep it at 2, which aligns with the client's previous successful experiences. Instead of larger batch sizes, I will maintain a batch size of 32, which fits into the medium-resource capability of the client. Lastly, for the server, I will set the learning rate at 0.001, which is consistent with its prior use, and retain the current optimizer and scheduler choice, ensuring uniform strategy throughout. The value of mu remains at 0.01, which is effective for the complexity involved in federated learning with SplitFed and FedProx regularization.",

The peers had varying success with learning rates of 0.0003 and 0.0005, leading to the conclusion that a moderate learning rate around 0.0005 would be effective for our client. Moderate learning rates help to avoid both underfitting and overfitting. The weight decay hyperparameter has helped peers achieve good accuracy without overfitting indicated by their learnings; therefore, I will set it to 0.0001 to start with regularization without impeding learning. Peer clients used a momentum of 0.9 effectively, which aligns with standard practices for SGD optimizers, so I\u2019ll stick to that. I will choose AdamW, as it is favorable for image classification tasks according to guidance. Considering I am not aware of the dataset behavior for the client yet, I will suggest a local_epochs of 2.0 as it seems to be a balanced choice among peers. A batch size of 32 is common and effective in their setups as well, fitting the medium-resource stipulation. Finally, I will set dropout_rate to 0.2, which has proven to work for peers while balancing the risk of overfitting. For the server, I will echo the client's learning rate of 0.001 as it aligns with the successful peer models and maintain a momentum of 0.9 with the same optimizer, AdamW. Lastly, I'll suggest no scheduler (None) for simplicity in this initial run as a complex scheduler may require further tuning that we don\u2019t have data on yet. For mu, I will set it to 0.01, which is an average value that helps in the FedProx regularization without overly impacting the clients' updates.",

The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to introduce stronger regularization, preventing overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9, as it was previously effective, and the dropout rate will be increased to 0.25 to help with regularization without overly penalizing the model's capacity. The local_epochs will remain at 3 to allow adequate training time, and the batch size will be set to 64, balancing computational load with performance needs. For the server settings, as no previous peer comparisons exist, I will mirror the client's optimizer and learning rate settings while keeping a similar momentum for stability.

The weight decay can be increased slightly to 0.0005 to mitigate overfitting, as high training accuracy could suggest this. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 as it has been effective in the past. The 'AdamW' optimizer is a strong choice for regularization, and I will introduce 'StepLR' for better learning rate scheduling. The local epochs can remain at 2, as this aligns with the previous successful epoch. Due to the low-resource nature of the client, I will set the batch size to 16, which seems to work well without overwhelming their resources. The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.2, as it balances between regularization and allows for learning. On the server side, I will mirror the client choices for stability and consistency in training, setting the learning rate at 0.001, momentum at 0.9, and using 'AdamW' with no scheduler to keep things straightforward. For the mu parameter, a value of 0.01 will be used to apply some level of FedProx regularization without excessively inhibiting the learning process.

I will also keep the weight decay at 0.0001, as it is already low and may serve to minimize overfitting without severely impacting training. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it is shown to effectively help with convergence. I will switch from 'Adam' to 'AdamW' to include weight decay regularization which can help improve the model's generalization capabilities without increasing the risk of overfitting. The batch size remains at 16 as dictated by the constraints. The dropout rate is also retained at 0.3, balancing regularization and model performance. For the server parameters, I will retain the learning rate at 0.001, which is moderate and should help maintain effective communication without overshooting updates. The momentum stays at 0.9 and I will use 'AdamW' as well for server-side optimization consistency with the client.

Given that both training and testing accuracies are currently unknown, a cautious approach should be taken. I will start with a moderate learning rate to prevent both overfitting and underfitting. A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal as it is generally recommended for image classification tasks and allows the model to converge without overshooting. For weight decay, I will set it to 1e-04, providing light regularization without being too harsh since there are no observed signs of overfitting yet. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a common choice that aids in smoothing out optimization paths. I will use 'AdamW' for the optimizer as it has shown great performance in image tasks due to its adaptive nature and ability to handle sparsity. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually adjust the learning rate, promoting better convergence. As this is the first round, a local epochs value of 2 is reasonable, allowing the model to learn sufficiently without overloading the client. A batch size of 64 is selected, which is also a common practice for balancing training speed and model performance. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.3 is reasonable, adding regularization to mitigate overfitting risks as the model begins to learn. For the server, I will mirror the client\u2019s learning setup to ensure consistency during federated learning; hence the learning rate remains at 0.001, and the optimizer and scheduler are kept the same as the client's. The mu value should be set to 0.01 to maintain a healthy balance for FedProx regularization, ensuring client updates are stable while allowing reasonable adaptation.",

I will choose a new weight decay of 0.0005 to help regularize the model. The learning rate is currently set to 0.001, which is within constraints, but given the model's capacity and past performance, I will reduce it to 0.0005 to better manage learning while improving generalization. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW', which is known for its effectiveness in training deep networks like ResNet18. I will keep the batch size at 64 as it optimally balances training time and convergence given the client\u2019s medium-resource capacity, although the allowed options include 32 and 48. Keeping dropout at 0.3 helps mitigate overfitting while allowing the model to retain useful information. Additionally, I will maintain `local_epochs` at 2 based on previous usage while providing sufficient training for the data. For the server's parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001, momentum at 0.9, and optimizer 'AdamW', similar to the client, ensuring consistency in model updates across both client and server.

Previous trials indicate a learning_rate of 0.001 may be a bit aggressive; I will opt for a lower learning_rate of 0.0005 to balance with the model's strengths while adhering to constraints. The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0005 based on peer assessment indicating it can help mitigate slight overfitting concerns. The momentum will remain at 0.9, as it is consistent among peers and provides good stability. I'll keep the optimizer as AdamW based on its successful usage in previous rounds, and I will introduce a learning rate scheduler (CosineAnnealingLR) for better learning rate adjustment during training. The local_epochs will remain at 2, consistent with past values. Lastly, I will maintain a dropout_rate of 0.4, which has shown effectiveness. For the server parameters, keeping a learning_rate of 0.001 is appropriate as it maintains consistency with high-performing peers. The server optimizer and momentum will be set to AdamW and 0.9 respectively, ensuring continuity in client-server training dynamics, with scheduler set to None, as past setups have performed well without it.

The weight decay should be kept low, so I will maintain it at 0.0005, which has shown to manage overfitting without being overly aggressive. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' because it has performed better historically compared to 'SGD' or 'Adam'.

Given the constraints, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0004, which is the maximum allowable rate for stable training on low-resource clients. I will also slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0001 to better regularize the model, helping to prevent overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has been effective in providing a faster convergence rate. For the optimizer, 'AdamW' is chosen for its efficiency in training deep learning models and its performance on image classification tasks. The local_epochs will stay at 2, as increasing it further may not yield better performance in a resource-constrained environment. The batch size will remain at 16 since this is suitable for low-resource clients. Finally, the dropout rate is increased to 0.3 to further combat overfitting without hindering the learning experience. On the server side, I have chosen the same learning rate of 0.0004 for stability among clients, also using 'AdamW' as the optimizer with no specific scheduler since a simple and effective training setup is essential at this stage. The global parameter 'mu' is set to 0.01 to maintain a balance in regularization. Overall, these choices are aimed at preventing overfitting while maximizing the performance capabilities given the client's constraints.",

However, speaking to the constraints, I need to drop the learning_rate to the maximum allowed of 0.0003 to ensure compliance while trying to keep the training and validation curves in check. Increasing the weight_decay to 0.005 based on the recent fluctuations can also help mitigate overfitting concerns as seen in previous accuracy dips. Keeping the batch_size to 64 is not an option as only 32 or 48 are permitted; hence I will suggest batch_size as 32, matching with past configurations known to work in this context. The momentum will remain at 0.9 for stability. The optimizer will be SGD, which has consistently shown strong results in this scenario. A dropout_rate of 0.3 from the previous round will be maintained to aid generalization without being excessively conservative. On the server side, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.0005, as it is within range and allowed by the constraints, using SGD for optimization, which again seems to work better based on the client's history. Lastly, the mu parameter will remain at 0.01, consistent with peer configurations and effective in prior performance. Overall, these adjustments are intended to fine-tune the model's performance while adhering to all outlined constraints.",

I will keep the momentum at 0.9 based on its previous use, which has demonstrated stability. The optimizer will remain as 'Adam', as it has shown promising results, and the local_epochs will continue at 2 since it was effective. The batch size will be set to 16 to optimize the memory usage without fragmentation. The dropout rate is increased to 0.4 to help mitigate any overfitting, as indicated by the previously high training accuracies. For the server, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.0005, consistent with the peer reference while still being effective. The optimizer will remain 'Adam', with a momentum of 0.9 for consistency.

Analyzing peer performance, it is evident that lower learning rates are yielding better results, particularly in peer 288\u2019s case with a learning rate of 0.0003 resulting in 81.19%. Therefore, to optimize performance while adhering to the constraints, I suggest lowering the learning rate to 0.0004. I'm also maintaining the weight decay at 0.0005, which has been effective so far. The dropout rate gets a slight alteration from 0.4 to 0.3 to aim for better generalization without risking overfitting. For the optimizer, I recommend switching to 'Adam' since peer 288 showed promising results by doing so, possibly enhancing convergence speed given the current settings. The batch size is set to 32, which is stable and in the middle of the range, offering a balance between speed and gradient estimation efficiency. Therefore, the final parameters for the client side are established with a learning rate compatible with potential underfitting and a dropout rate that strategically addresses any overfitting. For the server, I retain similar settings to the previous due to consistency, opting for 'SGD' to align with typical setups and keep \u2018None\u2019 for the scheduler to avoid complication. Finally, I maintain mu at 0.01, which was effective in earlier tests."

For weight decay, I will slightly increase it to 0.0005 to help further regularize the model and combat any potential overfitting without risking underfitting. The optimizer will remain Adam since it has been effective in the past, and I'll retain the scheduler as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to manage the learning rate effectively during training. I'll set local_epochs to 2, akin to before, and increase the batch size to 128 since the client can handle it, which can improve convergence speed. Finally, increasing the dropout_rate to 0.35 can help improve generalization by preventing overfitting. On the server side, I will mirror these choices but introduce slight variance; I will stick with a server learning rate of 0.001 and keep the optimizer as Adam, maintaining consistency with the client's choice while utilizing 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the scheduler.

Since both the test and training accuracies are relatively close, this suggests that the model is not underfitting or overfitting severely. To maintain stability for the low-resource clients, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0005. The weight decay will be set to the maximum allowed (0.0005) to provide regularization against any potential overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has proven effective. The optimizer remains Adam, which is providing satisfactory results. The local_epochs are kept at 3, as this has shown to work without stability issues. The batch size remains at 16, within the limits for low-resource clients. The dropout rate stays at 0.2 since it helps control overfitting, and higher values may be unnecessary given the current model behavior. For the server side, I will set the learning rate at 0.001, a stable choice based on peer results, maintaining momentum at 0.9 with the same optimizer Adam, and no scheduler since it is less critical for the server.

However, for this new configuration, I will reduce the learning rate further to 0.0003, which is within the constraints and adheres to the guidance suggesting a conservative approach. The weight_decay has been moderately set in previous runs, but due to constraints, it will now be set to 0.0008 to provide regularization. The momentum remains constant at 0.9 as it has shown stable performance. The optimizer 'AdamW' will be retained due to its effective history in previous experiments. The local_epochs will remain at 2, balancing between training time and convergence. The batch_size is set at 16, consistent with previous executions. Given that dropout increased in the last experiment and improved test accuracy (from 71.17% to 74.46%), I suggest a dropout_rate of 0.4 to further prevent overfitting, keeping it within the allowed range. On the server side, keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 aligns with the peer history and is within the specified range. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' which shows reliable results. The scheduler will be set to 'None' based on past strategies maintaining consistent performance without complex adjustments.

However, we should focus on optimizing further given the task and constraints. The learning rate was set at 0.001, which is right at the upper limit for effective experimentation in this range. To mitigate potential overfitting, we will lower the learning_rate slightly to 0.0005, which is still in the allowed range and can provide a more stable convergence. Additionally, we will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 to add more regularization, as CIFAR10 is prone to overfitting, especially with complex models like ResNet18. The momentum of 0.9 has shown effectiveness and we will retain it, as it is within the bounds specified. For the optimizer, while AdamW was previously used, switching to SGD can sometimes yield better results in convergence and generalization for classification tasks like this, given the right parameters. We will stick with the same scheduler, 'CosineAnnealingLR', which is beneficial for gradually decreasing the learning rate. Only two local epochs will be kept as it's moderate enough for the client\u2019s capacity, while the batch size remains at 32 which is optimal for a medium-resource client. Lastly, the dropout rate can be increased to 0.4 to further assist in combating overfitting with higher model complexity. On the server-side, we will mirror these hyperparameters closely but utilize a higher learning rate of 0.001 to ensure swift convergence among federated clients under the controlled mu of 0.01, which is well within the allowable bounds.",

The optimizer will remain 'Adam', as it's effective for these tasks, and I will retain 'None' for the scheduler to maintain simplicity. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 as previously used, keeping computation reasonable for the medium-resource cluster, while the `batch_size` remains at 32 which balances training efficiency and memory. Finally, I will increase the `dropout_rate` from 0.2 to 0.3 in light of the extended performance history which suggests a need for greater dropout to combat overfitting. For the server, I will mirror the client's learning rate at 0.0005 and maintain the use of 'Adam' as the optimizer, while setting the scheduler to 'None', reflecting the current consistent structure.

For weight decay, a value of 1e-05 will provide light regularization which is important for image classification tasks while still allowing the model to learn effectively. I am opting to use the Adam optimizer, which is typically robust for image classification tasks and can adapt the learning rates for the parameters automatically. The scheduler is set to 'None' since it's the initial training round, making it straightforward. I will choose a batch size of 32, which is a reasonable setting for medium-resource clients, and set local_epochs to 3 to allow the model to learn adequately from the local data. A dropout rate of 0.2 is chosen to mitigate any potential overfitting right from the start, which is common with deeper architectures like ResNet18. For the server, I will mirror the client's learning rate, momentum, and optimizer for consistency in training dynamics.

Lowering the learning rate from 0.001 to a more conservative 0.0005 might help reduce the risk of overshooting the optimal solutions, given that the current accuracy, while respectable, suggests there may still be room for improvement. Increasing the weight decay to 0.0001 will introduce more regularization, potentially mitigating any overfitting that could arise from a high learning rate. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it strikes a good balance without causing instability. Using the AdamW optimizer can provide better generalization in image tasks compared to plain Adam or SGD, hence I will suggest that. The scheduler could be changed to 'StepLR' to adjust the learning rate dynamically based on training progress. Since the current local_epochs (3) is appropriate for the client's medium-resource capabilities, I will maintain that. The batch size of 32 is complying with the given constraints, so I will opt for 64 (the other option available) to potentially improve gradient estimation. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3, providing more robustness against overfitting. For the server parameters, the learning rate will also be set to 0.0005 to align with the client's updated rates, momentum remains at 0.9 with the AdamW optimizer and the same scheduler to maintain consistency in training dynamics. Lastly, I propose to keep mu at 0.01."

The test accuracy across trials indicates that although the accuracy is consistently improving, we are only slightly upgrading from 79.19% to 79.65%. This suggests there might be a need for some adjustments. Given the client's low-resource capacity, and to adhere to the identified trends: 1. The client's current learning rate is around 0.0003-0.0005, which is higher than our constraints (must be lower than or equal to 0.0002). Therefore, I will recommend a learning rate of 0.0002 to ensure stability. 2. The weight decay remains low (0.0001), thus I will set it at 0.0002 for better regularization as suggested in the guidelines. 3. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 is consistent with previous runs which have not shown issues. The optimizer will remain AdamW since it's effective for this task. 4. To maintain efficient training while staying within constraints, I will keep `batch_size` at 16, which has been used previously without indicating a problem in resource allocation. 5. The dropout rate was shifted from 0.2 to 0.3 in the last trial, achieving slightly better test accuracy. I'll revert it back to 0.25 to remain optimal and within constraints without overfitting risks. For the server's parameters, I'll maintain similar values to what has been found effective: learning rate at 0.0005, keeping the same momentum and optimizer as the client.

For the dropout_rate, setting it to 0.3 is a reasonable choice, taking into account effective prior usage and managing overfitting. The local_epochs remain at 2, providing a balance between training time and performance improvement while adhering to low-resource needs. The server's parameters are aligned with successful configurations while ensuring stability with a slightly higher learning_rate of 0.0005 to provide effective updates.

The weight decay will be set to 1e-05, which is towards the lower bound but helps with regularization. Given that the peer's use of AdamW did not perform as well and the client is in a low-resource setting, I will stick with SGD as it has worked reasonably well previously. The momentum is set to 0.9, following the client's history which has used this value effectively. As for the local epochs, keeping it at 2 will allow sufficient training time without overburdening the low-capacity client. The batch size needs to be 16 as per the options available, and to explore appropriate dropout, I will increase it to 0.4, balancing overfitting. For the server settings, a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen as it remains well within the constraints and is a common choice for stabilizing training.

This is coupled with a slightly increased weight decay to 0.0002 to help mitigate potential overfitting since the previous weight decay was lower (0.0001). The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has been effective in peers' configurations. I will keep the used optimizer 'AdamW' and the schedule 'CosineAnnealingLR' to maintain consistent training behavior. The local epochs will remain at 2 to ensure reasonable training duration in a low-resource setting. The batch size is set at 16 as per the client's history. Dropout rate is increased to 0.4 (from 0.3) to enhance generalization performance. For server parameters, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005 (closer to the previous server learning rate) as it is optimal for overall training performance, with momentum maintained at 0.9 and using the 'AdamW' optimizer consistent with client settings. Finally, I suggest a mu value of 0.01 to provide sufficient Prox regularization as tested in previous configurations."

To avoid overfitting, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0004, which is still close to the previous rate but within constraints. Since the last test accuracy suggests stability, I will raise the weight decay to 0.0008 to enhance regularization, preventing overfitting further. I maintain the momentum at 0.9, which is effective, and keep using 'AdamW' optimizer since it performs well with image classification tasks. I set the local_epochs to 2, which is consistent with the previous configurations that worked, and will use a batch_size of 32 as provided as a starting point. Lastly, I will increase the dropout_rate to 0.3 from 0.25 to see if it continues to help with overfitting and improve robustness. For the server, I opt to keep the learning rate at 0.001, as it was beneficial for the client, and I will continue using 'AdamW' optimizer for consistency. I will set the mu to 0.01, which has been used effectively in the previous runs. These adjustments aim to refine the model's performance while adhering to the constraints."

To address this, I'll slightly increase the learning rate to 0.0003 while still adhering to the constraint of being between 0.0001 and 0.0003. The weight decay will remain at 0.0005, as it's helping maintain the balance without inducing overfitting issues. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', which is suitable for the task. In terms of dropout, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3 to introduce a bit more regularization, while keeping the batch size at 128 since the client has previously worked well with it. On the server side, the parameters will remain consistent with a learning rate of 0.001 and an optimizer of 'AdamW' to ensure stability.

The learning rate will remain at 0.001, as it has been effective; however, I will increase the weight decay to 0.0007, slightly higher than the previous 0.0005, to improve regularization against potential overfitting. The dropout rate remains at 0.25 as it has not been a hindrance and offers a reasonable balance between model complexity and generalization. The server configuration will also retain the same learning rate of 0.001 and optimizer as the previous setup, ensuring consistency across clients, and I will use the same 'AdamW' as the optimizer for the server to match the client, enhancing stability.

Given the guidance for image models, maintaining a similar learning rate is beneficial, but I will decrease it slightly to 0.0005 to promote more stable convergence. Since the last training session resulted in relatively high test accuracy, increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0005 will help to mitigate the risk of overfitting. The `momentum` remains at 0.9, which has been effective. Opting for the `AdamW` optimizer is consistent with past successful deployments. The `scheduler` will be set to `CosineAnnealingLR`, which can improve performance in mid to later stages of training. With `local_epochs` set to 2, this balances adequate training with the medium resource capacity of the client. The `batch_size` will remain 32, previously shown to function well without exceeding memory constraints. The `dropout_rate` is increased to 0.4, which aims to further reduce overfitting while enhancing model generalization. For the server-side, the learning rate remains consistent with the previous value of 0.001. The same choices for `momentum` and `optimizer` will be maintained for stability.

The momentum is kept at 0.9 as it's optimal from previous runs. The optimizer 'AdamW' has consistently resulted in good performance, and I will keep that unchanged. The scheduler 'CosineAnnealingLR' is retained for its benefits in managing the learning rate during training. The local epochs are set to 2 to balance training and efficiency, and the batch size remains at 32, consistent with previous successful runs. Given the outcome of enhancing the dropout rate from 0.3 to 0.4 previously helped in reducing overfitting, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.4 as a precautionary measure. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and utilize the same optimizer and scheduler, as they have not shown any detrimental effects.

However, the learning rate is approaching the upper limit of the allowable range. Given that both training and test accuracies are fairly close, it suggests that overfitting is not a significant issue. Hence, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.005 to allow the model to fine-tune without overshooting minima in the loss landscape. The weight_decay is currently at 0.0001, which is on the lower end, but given that our test accuracy is good, maintaining it at 0.0001 should suffice since the model is not exhibiting signs of overfitting. Maintaining the current momentum of 0.9 will help effectively navigate the loss landscape. I will retain the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has shown good performance, and I'll set the scheduler to 'None' because no adjustments seem necessary at this point. The local_epochs are kept at 2.0 within the allowed range, suggesting a decent balance between training time and performance improvements. With respect to batch_size, for a high-resource client like Cluster 2, I will increase it to 256 since the model can handle this larger size effectively. The dropout_rate is increased slightly to 0.25 from 0.2, which can help further regularize the model without significantly hurting performance. For the server parameters, given the client\u2019s last settings, I am going to maintain a learning_rate of 0.001 to ensure that updates from clients remain effective but conservative, as our test accuracy needs to be robust across all clients. The server optimizer is also set to 'AdamW' for consistency. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, which balances the influence of local objectives in the federated setting effectively.",

As the last few epochs have shown a test accuracy plateau around 82.07%, it might be prudent to maintain a similar learning rate rather than risk overshooting with a higher value. The current weight decay of 0.0009 seems adequate; however, considering the observed gains in test accuracy at 0.0008 by a peer, a slight adjustment down to 0.0008 should help with regularization without dramatically changing the learning dynamics. The batch size can be increased to the maximum of 256 to leverage the high-resource capacity of the client, which would improve its speed without compromising performance, as both previous trials with batch sizes of 128 and 256 yielded similar test accuracies. The dropout rate remains at 0.3 to mitigate overfitting tendencies as consistent high training accuracy coupled with lower test accuracy might suggest overfitting. Regarding the server settings, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 ensures stability across the federated learning setup since test accuracies of peers using slightly higher server learning rates have marked decreases in the last rounds, and a consistent momentum of 0.9 helps ensure stability. The `mu` value remains at 0.05 as it has proven effective in balancing the local disadvantage of the split federated scheme. These choices should guide the model towards better generalization while optimizing resources.",

Considering the peer's settings, particularly Client 360's successful use of a learning rate of 0.00025, I will adopt the same low learning rate to prevent potential instability. The weight decay will be kept relatively low at 1e-05, aligning with the peer's setting, since there is no indication of overfitting at this stage. I will use the AdamW optimizer, recognized for its efficiency in such tasks, and a momentum of 0.9 for effective gradient descent. Given the low-resource nature of the client, I will use a batch size of 12, the maximum that is available within an even lower constraint (12 is not a valid option, so I will adjust it instead to comply and choose a batch size of 16 for stability). The dropout rate is set to 0.4, as seen in the peer's setup, to help mitigate any risk of overfitting when adding complexity to the model. On the server side, to maintain uniformity, I will suggest the same learning rate, momentum, and optimizer as the client.

This indicates potential instability in training. Given the guidance advising a lower learning rate when dealing with fluctuations, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0001 for the client, as it's the lowest permissible value in the range and can facilitate stability. Considering the client's low resource status, a batch size of 4 is efficient and appropriate. The previous run showed improved performance at a dropout rate of 0.25, but to better combat overfitting, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.3. For weight decay, I'll keep it at 0.0003 since increasing it may help with regularization, but staying within guidance limits. The server's learning rate is retained at 0.001 to maintain momentum while staying within the recommended range. I will utilize 'AdamW' for both client and server optimizers, as it has been performed well in past tests. The 'StepLR' scheduler will be employed for the client's learning rate to allow controlled decay over epochs. Lastly, I will keep the mu parameter at 0.01 derived from previous experiments, as it has shown consistency across rounds.",

Given the observed trend, I propose to maintain the learning rate at the lowest acceptable value of 0.0001, as it has been consistently leading to improved results without overfitting. I will keep the weight decay at 0.0005 to balance model complexity and maintain regularization. The optimizer should remain as 'AdamW' because it's been effective in prior usage; adjusting towards 'SGD' may destabilize learning, especially in a low-resource setting. We will preserve the 'local_epochs' at 2 as this has been providing a good balance of training time while allowing the model sufficient updates. The 'batch_size' will remain at 16 to match previous successful setups. The dropout rate stays at 0.4 to help manage overfitting tendencies noted from the high train accuracy seen in past trials. On the server side, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0002, which has also shown good performance in client history and aligns with the consistency needed for stability across federated learning. The same optimizer and momentum settings will be maintained for the server as well. Finally, I will set mu to 0.01, reflecting consistency and alignment with successful usage in the previous session."

Given that the testing accuracy is relatively high, but not perfect, it suggests that the model could benefit from a balance of regularization and learning rate adjustments. Since the previous learning rate was at 0.001, which is at the upper end of the allowed range, I will lower it to 0.0005 to potentially improve generalization and avoid overfitting. Regarding the weight_decay, I will increase it slightly to 0.0005 to reinforce regularization and further combat any tendencies to overfit, especially when using a deep model like ResNet18. I will continue using the 'Adam' optimizer as it provides good convergence properties and matches the client's previous successful choice. The batch_size will be set at 32, which seems supportive of the medium resource capability; however, as per constraints of allowed sizes, I will set it to 16. For momentum, retaining it at 0.9 aligns well with common practices in image classification and has been effective based on prior usage. A dropout_rate of 0.3 should help with regularization to mitigate the risk of overfitting. For the server parameters, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 for a well-rounded approach as it's within the constraints and has not yielded significant issues previously. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as it balances well with the optimizer. I suggest 'CosineAnnealingLR' for the server optimizer to dynamically adjust learning rates during training.

Additionally, I will increase the weight_decay to 3e-05 to add regularization and mitigate overfitting, as the test accuracy is not significantly higher than the training accuracy. I will maintain the momentum at 0.9 as previously used, as it is within acceptable bounds and has likely contributed positively to the performance. The choice of the optimizer will switch to AdamW for better weight decay handling. The local_epochs are set to 2, which is moderate for the model training size, and the batch_size will be reduced to 32 to accommodate the medium resource capacity. The dropout_rate is increased to 0.3, as this increased level should help with overfitting. On the server-side, I will also choose a learning_rate of 0.0005 for consistency with the client parameters and setting the momentum to 0.9 as it aligns with effective practices. Lastly, I will keep mu at 0.01 which aligns with previous holds and helps control the FedProx regularization effectively."

Since batch sizes of 256 have been used successful recently by the client with improvements in accuracy, I will keep this size. Increasing the dropout rate to 0.4 has shown promising results, which appears to help against overfitting, thus it will be reverted to this level. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' because that is consistent with successful trials, and a scheduler of 'CosineAnnealingLR' will be retained to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training. The server's parameters will stay unchanged from the client's last iteration due to good performance and the absence of direct issues regarding server-side hyperparameters.

Therefore, I will try a learning rate of 0.0015, which is the maximum possible within the given range, to allow for potentially better convergence. Additionally, to prevent overfitting, I am raising the weight decay to 0.001, also the maximum allowable value, which is supported by the fact that the client's previous best accuracy has not improved significantly. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which is standard practice for 'AdamW.'. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' is ultimately effective given its benefits for deep learning tasks, particularly with CNNs like ResNet. I will maintain the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler since it was utilized before without issue. The local epochs should remain at 3 for maximal training without resulting in saturation, plus a batch size of 128 as it has been working well, and I will increase dropout to 0.5 to induce further regularization, given that it's permissible. For the server hyperparameters, maintaining the same learning rate of 0.001 is reasonable as it ensured stability and consistency was there, along with the proactive adjustment of enabling the same optimizer scheme, 'AdamW' that the client uses for continuity.

Given the low-resource nature of the client, we need to adjust their hyperparameters within the allowed constraints. Since the last test accuracy was robust at 82.48%, we can slightly reduce the learning rate to 0.0003 to enhance stability, while also keeping the weight_decay high at 0.001 to combat any potential overfitting. For momentum, we maintain the value at 0.9 which has been effective thus far. To ensure stability, we keep the batch size at 16 and local_epochs at 2. The dropout rate is set to 0.4 as it has previously shown good effects in controlling overfitting without drastically harming performance. On the server side, we will also adopt a modest learning_rate of 0.0004, consistent with peer strategies but not exceeding constraints, using the SGD optimizer to complement the client's choice. The momentum remains at 0.9 to synchronize with client-side updates. The mu parameter is kept at 0.01, which provides a balanced regularization effect without compromising the federated learning framework.",

This suggests that a lower learning rate may help enhance convergence and stability. The weight decay was consistently set at 0.0002 over the last few epochs, supporting the idea that a modest level of regularization is beneficial. For dropout rate, 0.4 has shown to contribute positively to the performance without severe overfitting as evidenced by the increases in accuracy up to 80.12%. Thus, I recommend slightly raising the batch size to 64 for potentially enhanced computational efficiency while adhering to client resource constraints. The local epochs remain at 3 to ensure adequate training time. For the server parameters, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is reasonable given it served well historically, while weight momentum and optimizer choices remain unchanged at default values known to function effectively in this context. The mu parameter of 0.01 will help in controlling the effect of the FedProx regularization without steering requests away from the client too aggressively.",

The optimizer remains AdamW as it has been used effectively in the past. I recommend increasing the dropout_rate to 0.3 from 0.4 to prevent overfitting while still encouraging generalization. The batch size of 32 will maximize the available computational resources, and local epochs will remain at 2 for stable training.

The last successful configuration achieved a test accuracy of 82.49%, which is a strong indication of the model's capability with the current setup. However, there's room for improvement by considering the guidance provided. Given that the learning rates in previous tries yielded good results, I will adjust the learning rate slightly lower to avoid overfitting, following the guidance recommendations. Additionally, the use of a higher weight decay may help limit overfitting. The dropout rate will be retained at 0.3 as it has previously shown effectiveness. The optimizer will need to align with allowed choices, hence I will opt for 'Adam' to ensure robustness as it often performs well on image classification tasks. For the server, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001 as it's already yielding good results and stick with 'SGD' optimizer while using 'StepLR' for scheduling. The value of mu will be set at 0.02, maintaining consistency with past configurations and ensuring effective FedProx regularization.",

However, there is a slight pattern of underperformance due to similar configurations being used by peers leading to slightly lower accuracies. The client has used a learning rate of 0.001 previously, which is at the higher end for the allowed range. In analyzing the performance of peers, I noticed that a higher learning rate (with adjustments in weight decay as needed) has not consistently yielded better results, suggesting that a lower learning rate might be beneficial to stabilize training and allow for better convergence. Therefore, I will maintain the learning rate at the maximum allowed (0.0005) to ensure stable yet effective learning. To combat overfitting, the weight_decay will be adjusted slightly higher to 0.0006. The optimizer choice will remain as SGD because that has proven successful in previous configurations, and I will keep the dropout_rate at 0.3 since it appears to be a sweet spot for balancing capacity and generalization. The local_epochs will remain at 2 to maintain training duration while batch size continues to be 128 for effective processing by the client. As for the server, I will suggest keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 since it has not shown any signs of overfitting or underfitting across peers, thus ensuring stability and reliable performance across federated rounds. For the global parameter mu, I will set this to be 0.02, the same as used in previous configurations, which has yielded promising results. Overall, these parameters are geared towards maximizing training effectiveness while controlling for potential overfitting.",

Notably, other clients have experimented with varying learning rates and weight decay, achieving similar accuracies. Given that 'Client 264' saw better results with a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0005, I will keep this learning rate for consistency and potential stability in training. However, to address any potential overfitting (as seen in previous runs), I will slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0003, which is still within the allowed range and could help regularize the model further. The chosen optimizer remains 'Adam' due to its strong performance in previous epochs. I will also increase the dropout rate to 0.4 (from 0.3) as a preventive measure against overfitting, given the high-capacity cluster's ability to manage this. For the batch size, I'll use 128, which balances efficiency and performance. Lastly, I will keep the server-side learning rate consistent at 0.001 with the 'Adam' optimizer, which has proven effective, while increasing mu to 0.02, aligning with a peer's approach who achieved slightly better performance with a similar structure. Maintaining these adjustments aligns strategy with history while adhering strictly to constraint ranges.",

The latest test accuracy of 82.23% suggests that the learning rate could still be tuned down. As per previous attempts, the learning rate of 0.002 was too aggressive, likely leading to minor overfitting as indicated by the testing results. I will select a lower learning rate of 0.001, as it has been used successfully in previous configurations. Weight decay of 0.0003 will be maintained, as it has positively contributed without explicit signs of overfitting in previous epochs. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW,' consistent with successful peer usage. I am also increasing the dropout rate to 0.3, which has been beneficial in peer Client 152's results. Given the client's high-resource capabilities, I will increase the batch size to 256 to leverage more parallel computing power. Local epochs will remain at 2 to foster a balance between speed and convergence. For the server parameters, the learning rate will remain at 0.001, following the consistency shown in test scores. I will keep using 'AdamW' optimizer on the server side, accompanied by 'None' for the scheduler, to minimize complexity. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01 as observed in recent successful setups, which has shown balance in federated learning performance.",
