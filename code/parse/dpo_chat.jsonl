I will set a moderate `learning_rate` of 0.001 to ensure stable convergence without overshooting optimal weights, which is especially important for medium-resource clients. For `weight_decay`, I will choose 1e-04 to help prevent overfitting, balancing model capacity and generalization. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, a common choice for helping accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. The optimizer will be 'SGD', a widely used method that generally performs well for image classification tasks. The `scheduler` will be set to 'StepLR' to reduce the learning rate at specific intervals, which helps fine-tune the training as it progresses. Given the resource constraints of Cluster 1, I will set `local_epochs` to 2 and `batch_size` to 32 for a good balance of training stability and throughput. The `dropout_rate` will be set to 0.2 to help combat overfitting without excessively hindering learning. On the server side, I will align the learning rate, momentum, optimizer, and scheduler choices with those of the client to maintain consistency in the training process. The value of `mu` will be set to 0.01, which is a moderate regularization value to control the contribution of the proximal term in the Federated learning setup."}}

The test accuracy increased significantly from 69.97% to 77.00% when using a learning rate of 0.0005, suggesting that a slight decrease may yield better results, so I've set the learning rate to 0.0003, which is still conservative and within the required range.

To combat potential challenge with overfitting in the future, I will set the dropout_rate to 0.3, which provides a balance between retaining information and regularization. For the server, I will retain the learning rate at 0.001, ensuring it's conservative without being too low for effective communication during federated learning. The momentum will be kept at 0.9, and I'll maintain the Adam optimizer with the CosineAnnealingLR scheduler, which can help in adjusting the learning rate over time effectively.

To further improve training without risking overfitting, I propose slightly increasing the learning rate to 0.0006 and adjusting the weight decay to 0.0001 to increase regularization. The momentum remains at 0.9 for stability. The optimizer 'AdamW' has been successful in previous runs and will be maintained. A batch_size of 64 will be used to leverage the client's high-resource capability, and local_epochs will remain at 2 to balance between learning and convergence speed. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.4 to combat any potential overfitting as we adjust learning parameters. On the server-side, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.0003, momentum at 0.9, and the 'AdamW' optimizer for consistency in client-server interactions. The mu will remain at 0.01 to moderate the FedProx regularization without making drastic changes."}}

The weight decay will be increased to 0.0001 to help combat any potential overfitting observed in previous runs. The momentum remains at 0.9 as it aligns with common best practices for CNNs, and the choice of optimizer will continue with 'AdamW' which has been beneficial. The local epochs will stay at 2 despite being at the upper range since this cluster can afford moderate local training, and the batch size of 64 will be reverted to the valid option of 32 to accommodate lower resources as well as maintaining efficiency. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.2 to help improve generalization without excessive dropouts. As for the server parameters, I will retain the learning rate at 0.001, keeping it conservative, and keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' alongside the previously effective 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler to manage learning rate schedules effectively. The global parameter mu will remain at 0.01, which aligns well with the federated scheme being employed."}}

A learning rate of 0.0002 is optimal as it's less than the previous rate and aligns with the adaptation strategy. For weight decay, I will slightly increase it to 0.0002 to help mitigate any overfitting risks, which is particularly relevant given the moderate test performance. The momentum is kept at 0.9, matching the peer's settings, which is typically effective in conjunction with AdamW. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' as it has performed well in previous trials. The dropout rate remains at 0.4 to balance regularization without being too aggressive, maintaining what has yielded acceptable test results previously. The batch size is fixed at 16 as per constraints and compatibility with the client's moderate capacity. The local epochs remain at 3 since this allows sufficient training without overwhelming the client’s resources. On the server side, the learning rate is kept at 0.001, as this approach has shown stability in peer tests, ensuring effective communication and updates during federated learning. The optimizer on the server also remains 'AdamW,' with scheduling set to 'None' since peers did not report improved performance with a scheduler. Lastly, I will maintain mu at 0.01, as a slight increase could be warranted but should be tested gradually, aligning with prior setups.", "reasoning_rejected": "The previous test accuracy of 75.14% indicates potential underfitting, as the training accuracy also seems to be low. Thus, increasing the `learning_rate` to 0.0003 would help to improve the model's learning capability.

Maintaining the current `momentum` of 0.9 is a solid choice, as it is within the optimal range. The `optimizer` will remain as AdamW, which performed well for both the client and in peer history. I will recommend `local_epochs` of 3 to fully utilize training data, while `batch_size` will be set to 16 to balance computational load and learning stability. Given previous experiments with a `dropout_rate` of 0.4, I will keep it the same to mitigate overfitting without the risk of underutilization.

Maintaining a momentum of 0.9 aligns with common practices for optimization stability. The optimizer remains as 'AdamW' to leverage adaptive learning rates. Since the batch size of 64 has been previously used without issues, it will be retained, alongside a local epoch of 2 to provide a balanced approach between training duration and resource management. The dropout rate is adjusted upwards to 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting risk, aiming for improved generalization. On the server side, keeping the learning rate at 0.005 encourages robust client updates, while using 'AdamW' helps maintain optimization efficiency. The momentum remains at 0.9 for stability. A 'None' scheduler is chosen since it allows for consistent updates without additional complexity.
