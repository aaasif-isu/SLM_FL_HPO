Considering the nature of the problem and the absence of previous rounds, I will use `AdamW` as the optimizer for its adaptive learning capabilities.

Additionally, a weight decay of 1e-04 is chosen to provide a small amount of regularization without overly restricting the model's learning capacity.

The dropout rate is set to 0.3 to help mitigate potential overfitting without excessively limiting the model's learning capacity. For the server, a learning rate of 0.001 is also suggested to maintain consistent training across clients, and I will select 'SGD' as the optimizer, which can benefit from being conservative in such federated learning scenarios.

I will set the learning rate to 0.0005, which is the highest allowed in the constrained range, to enhance the model's learning process. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 to prevent overfitting since ResNet models can easily overfit on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has proven effective in the past. The optimizer will be switched to AdamW for better regularization, which can help with the learning dynamics. I will continue using a batch size of 32 because it is within the allowed options, although I need to choose either 16 or 24; I will choose 24 to optimize resource usage.

Therefore, I suggest lowering the learning rate to 0.0005, which is the maximum allowed to encourage closer exploration towards potential optimal points. Additionally, an increase in weight_decay to 0.001 will help combat overfitting. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is appropriate as it has been consistently used in the past, promoting stable convergence. The optimizer remains set to 'SGD', which has been validated through usage. A dropout_rate of 0.3 is an effective choice, offering a balance between too little regularization and preventing overfitting. The local_epochs remain at 2, suitable given the client's medium-resource constraints and previous usage. For the server parameters, I suggest using a learning rate of 0.0005, the same as the client, to promote cohesive training, with a momentum set at 0.9 and 'SGD' as the optimizer, since it aligns with prior performance evaluations.

To combat potential overfitting (if high train accuracy were evident), we could consider increasing the weight decay to support regularization; I'll set it to 0.0005 to see if it helps in improving generalization. I'll also moderate the learning rate to 0.0005, which is within constraints and might help improve stability and convergence.

The dropout rate remains at the lower bound of 0.1 to facilitate learning without significant reduction in capacity. For local epochs, I will maintain it at 2, which allows sufficient training without overloading the client's resources. For the server, I suggest the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate also of 0.001, consistent with the client to ensure convergence alignment without increasing complexity.

A dropout rate of 0.2 is likely sufficient to mitigate any overfitting without being overly aggressive in such a low-resource context.

Additionally, I'll increase the weight decay to 0.0005 within the accepted limits as there might be slight overfitting. The momentum remains at 0.9 since it has shown stability in trials. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' and retain the same scheduler (None), as there hasn't been substantial evidence to change these. Given the moderate resource capacity (Cluster 1), keeping `local_epochs` at 2 will help maintain efficiency and the batch size at 64 is on the higher end to allow for better generalization of features. I will increase the dropout rate slightly to 0.2 to help mitigate any signs of overfitting, balancing it with maintaining learning capability.

However, given that the client is categorized as 'High-Resource', we can leverage their capacity for more aggressive hyperparameter settings. The primary task is image classification using ResNet18 on CIFAR10, which typically benefits from a balanced learning rate and optimized regularization through weight decay. I will set the learning rate to a common optimal value of 0.001, which avoids the pitfalls of being too high (leading to underfitting) while maintaining good learning momentum. The `weight_decay` is set to 0.0005, which is a moderate value that would assist in addressing any potential overfitting while remaining within the constraints. We\u2019ll select 'SGD' as the optimizer, as it generally provides better performance in image classification tasks with potential momentum enhancements. The `momentum` is set at 0.9, a standard value that works well by stabilizing the updates during training. For batch size, I will opt for 64, suitable for high-resource clients to fully utilize their capabilities without overflowing memory. A dropout rate of 0.3 will be effective at regularizing the model and preventing overfitting while retaining significant capacity for feature learning. On the server side, I'll mirror the client settings closely to ensure consistency in training dynamics, also using 0.001 for the learning rate, 'SGD' for the optimizer, and a momentum of 0.9. Additionally, I will not employ a scheduling strategy for now to keep the initial step straightforward.

However, to ensure stable training on a low-resource client, I will suggest a lower learning rate. Therefore, I recommend a learning rate of 0.0001, which is at the lower bound of the acceptable range. Additionally, the client should stick with the existing weight decay of 0.0003, as it has helped control overfitting in previous iterations. The learning rate and weight decay are within the appropriate ranges for ensuring stability in training on low-resource devices. A momentum of 0.9 is appropriate and consistent with previous setups as it can help accelerate SGD in the relevant direction. Keeping the optimizer as SGD is a good choice as it has been used successfully in prior configurations, thus continuity is essential. The dropout rate of 0.35 was effective previously, and will help in reducing overfitting while not increasing it beyond the current level. The local epochs are set to 2 as this value has previously proven effective without overconsuming client resources. The batch size is kept at 16 since it is the same as the client's past settings and fits within the low-resource constraints. For the server, I will maintain the server learning rate at 0.001 since it has been consistent in yielding acceptable performance. Using the same optimizer and momentum from the client settings helps maintain congruence across training efforts.

Given the image classification task and the client medium-resource capacity, a weight decay of 0.0001 will help with potential overfitting while remaining minimal to avoid underfitting. For the optimizer, I will select 'AdamW', which is well-suited for image tasks due to its adaptive learning capabilities and better handling of sparse gradients. The momentum is set to 0.9, a standard choice for momentum-based optimizers that often helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. With a batch size of 32, we balance between training time and memory usage given the client's medium capacity. I choose to set local_epochs to 2, as this strikes a balance between insufficient learning and excessive resource consumption, especially considering the absence of previous insights.

This indicates that the hyperparameters have been somewhat effective but may still be optimized further. Since the learning rate used in earlier epochs (0.001) was too high for optimal performance, and the current learning rate (0.0005) seems close to its maximum threshold, I suggest reducing the learning rate to 0.0003, which is just under the recently effective value but remains well within the allowed range. This will slow down the learning process slightly, allowing more careful convergence on relevant features in the data. The weight decay is currently at 0.0005, which helps regularization. However, to mitigate any potential overfitting issues observed in the past (noted by the difference in accuracies), I propose increasing the weight decay to 0.001 to enhance regularization further. The dropout rate currently set at 0.1 seemed insufficient as evidenced by the results from peer 485 (0.4). To address possible overfitting and improve generalization, I will increase the dropout rate to 0.2, which should help balance training without overly hampering learning. The other hyperparameters such as momentum (0.9), optimizer (AdamW), and local epochs (2) remain appropriate given their consistency with successful configurations in peer setups. I will keep the batch size at 64, as it fits the client's medium-resource capacity while allowing effective training. On the server side, I will maintain the learning rate at 0.001, as it remains effective for relevant stakeholders and is consistent with the past configurations.

Additionally, I'll select a batch size of 32, which is a balanced choice between robustness and performance for medium-resource clients while following peer configurations closely. The dropout rate will be set to 0.2 to introduce some regularization and prevent potential overfitting without sacrificing learning capability. For the server's parameters, I will match the learning rate at 0.001 (slightly higher than client to ensure broader updates) and also use AdamW, which is consistent and has proven effective among peers. Finally, the mu value is set at 0.01 in alignment with the peer configurations to maintain consistency in training updates.",

We'll maintain a relatively low learning_rate of 0.0005 to ensure smooth training, as both accuracies show less than ideal improvement when moved higher. To combat overfitting, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to its upper limit of 0.0002, as higher regularization may help to reduce overfitting. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, continuing to allow for effective optimization. The optimizer stays on 'AdamW' as it has been successful historically. Since the batch_size options are limited and 32 isn't available, we'll select 24 as a reasonable alternative, ensuring we adhere to resource constraints and leaving headroom for computational efficiency. We'll also retain dropout_rate at 0.3 to further help with possible overfitting while staying below the maximum cap. For the server parameters, the learning_rate remains at 0.001 which is within a safe operational window conducive to collaboration during federated training. The momentum isn\u2019t modified and remains at 0.9, along with using 'AdamW' for the server's optimization to mirror the client for consistency in performance.

I recommend using the `AdamW` optimizer for better performance on image classification tasks compared to SGD, especially in a federated setup. The `scheduler` is set to `CosineAnnealingLR` to allow for dynamic learning rate adjustments that may aid in better convergence over training epochs.

I will use 'SGD' as the optimizer for its robustness in image classification tasks and support for momentum, which I will set to 0.9.

Considering the nature of image classification tasks and the guidance that suggests lower learning rates for high overfitting risk or when addressing low-resource scenarios, this is a safe starting point. For weight decay, a value of 1e-04 is chosen to apply a small regularization effect, which is suitable given that the task is prone to overfitting. The momentum of 0.9 is typical for momentum-based optimizers and should help accelerate SGD in certain directions during training. For the optimizer, 'SGD' is chosen as it is generally more stable and performs well with less computational resources compared to 'Adam' or 'AdamW'. A local_epochs value of 1 is selected because the client is low-resource, thus limiting computational demands. A batch_size of 16 is also moderately small, which aligns with the client\u2019s capacity, ensuring they can process the data without overwhelming their resources. The dropout_rate is set to 0.2 to help mitigate potential overfitting without severely impacting learning.

A batch_size of 32 balances between updating the weights frequently and utilizing the available resources efficiently.

A `batch_size` of 64 is fitting for a high-resource client, promoting good gradient estimates without memory overflow. A `dropout_rate` of 0.3 is reasonable to encourage generalization without excessively removing information. For the server\u2019s hyperparameters, I kept the `learning_rate` at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9, which are standard for robustness. The `Adam` optimizer is aligned for consistency with the client-side's strategy, and a `None` scheduler is appropriate as we are not dynamically adjusting the learning rate at this stage. The `mu` parameter is set at 0.01 to slightly regularize the federated approach without overwhelming the model updates.",

Therefore, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0004 to encourage more stable training. Additionally, weight decay has been set to 0.0008; given the trend in increasing performance, we want to ensure regularization while being cautious, so I will suggest leaving it slightly higher at 0.0007. The momentum remains stable at 0.9, consistent with previous successful trials. The usage of 'AdamW' will remain the same, as the optimizer has worked well.

However, the strategy will implement a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0005 to minimize the chances of overfitting and to facilitate better convergence in subsequent local updates. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0008 to promote regularization and combat potential overfitting, as high training accuracy but comparatively lower test accuracy can be indicative of such issues. The momentum will be maintained at 0.9 as it currently suits both the optimizer and the training dynamics. The chosen optimizer will remain 'AdamW' as it effectively addresses issues of weight decay inherent in the architecture. Local epochs will remain at 2, and the batch size will remain at 64 to manage memory usage while still offering sufficient data per update. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.35 to further aid in mitigating overfitting. On the server side, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 allows for stability in global model updates, while ensuring momentum stays at 0.9 supports the adaptive optimization strategy. The same optimizer 'AdamW' will be employed at the server level to maintain consistency in the optimization approach.

The weight decay has gradually increased, but it's currently at 0.0006; hence I will increase it slightly to 0.0007, which still stays within the allowed range, to combat potential overfitting. The dropout rate of 0.4 was previously applied without significant negative impact, so I will retain it, as it might contribute towards regularization. For server parameters, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0005, which was previously effective, alongside the same optimizer (AdamW) for consistency and stability across runs. The mu value will remain at 0.01, which has been tested and proven for this federated setup, balancing the regularization without additional complexity.",

I will keep the optimizer as SGD, which is consistent with the client's history. The weight decay will be increased to 0.0005 for additional regularization since CIFAR-10 is a relatively complex dataset and regularization could help improve test accuracy. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 should be beneficial for the optimization process, so I will not change it. The local epochs remain at 2.0, balancing between effective training and avoiding excessive computation for a medium-resource client. I will also keep the batch size at 32 and dropout at 0.2 based on the previous settings which provided a balanced performance. For the server settings, a learning rate of 0.001 keeps the server's training stable and aligns with the client's tuning, so I will retain it.

The scheduler will be set to 'None' since the initial rounds might not require special scheduling. I suggest 'local_epochs' of 2 based on peer usage and the capacity of high-resource clients, allowing sufficient training without overextending.

I will choose momentum of 0.9, as it is effective in stabilizing training dynamics and is also seen in the peer client.

Given the guidance suggesting that low-resource clients may require smaller batch sizes or lower learning rates, I will set the 'learning_rate' to 0.0005 (a moderate choice, linked to general peer performance) and 'batch_size' to the smallest option of 8. The 'weight_decay' will be set at 1e-06 to minimize overfitting risk while maintaining some regularization.

The weight decay of 0.0005 used by Client 223 also aligns with best practices for regularization to mitigate overfitting, making it a prudent choice. The momentum of 0.9 is standard for many models, aiding in faster convergence, so I will adopt that value as well. The optimizer 'AdamW' is effective for such tasks, providing a good balance of adaptive learning with weight decay. A dropout rate of 0.4 has been beneficial in peer performance; however, since this is the first round, I will suggest a slightly lower dropout rate of 0.3, which still provides regularization while allowing for learning. Batch size should be adequate to exploit the high-resource capability of the client, thus a size of 128 is both powerful and permissible. Local epochs are set to 2 for a balance between sufficient training and resource usage.

For the weight_decay, a value of 0.0001 is low but will help slightly counteract overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively in its initial training phase. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a common choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, improving convergence speed. My optimizer choice is 'AdamW', known for its efficient performance on tasks like image classification. The scheduler will be 'CosineAnnealingLR', which helps in cyclic learning rates, aiding convergence during training. Given the high-resource capacity of the client, a local_epochs value of 3 will be chosen for thorough training. The batch_size of 64 is substantial and aligns with client capabilities. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is selected to help regularize the model without being too aggressive, striking a balance for this initial training run.

The client\u2019s batch_size will stay at 32 since it provides a good balance for medium-resource capabilities. I will set local_epochs to 2, as this has been common among peers and fits within the constraints. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW', showing effectiveness in previous runs. The server parameters will mirror the client learning rate but sit within the broader range \u2014 thus, I\u2019ll keep it at 0.001 with the same optimizer and momentum. I will use 'None' for the server\u2019s scheduler as the previous configuration has not implemented any, and I will set mu at 0.01 to maintain consistency with the client's last experiment.",

The task is image classification using ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Considering the potential for underfitting given that there are no prior results to lean on, it is prudent to select a slightly higher `learning_rate`. Therefore, I have set the `learning_rate` to 0.005. This value is well within the allowed range and should provide a good balance between learning speed and stability. For the `weight_decay`, I will choose a moderate value of 0.0005. This choice is justified because it helps regularize the model, especially in image classification tasks where overfitting is common, yet I want to ensure that it does not hinder convergence. The `momentum` is set to 0.9, which is a standard practice and often provides better convergence, as well as helping to smooth the optimization paths. Given the moderate resource capacity of the client, I will recommend a `batch_size` of 32. This is a balanced choice; it\u2019s large enough to benefit from batch normalization while remaining feasible given the client's capacity. I will also set `local_epochs` to 2 to ensure sufficient training without overburdening the client resources. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.3 based on the recommendation to limit overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. On the server side, I am also recommending a `learning_rate` of 0.005, similar to the client, to encourage cohesive training dynamics across clients. The momentum and optimizer choices mirror those made for the client. I will use the `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler, as it is generally effective in managing the learning rate dynamically during training, which can be particularly beneficial in a federated learning setting.

I'll set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is a standard choice for starting training as it is neither too aggressive nor too passive, thus helping to prevent both underfitting and overfitting in this initial round. For weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0001 to introduce a small amount of regularization to help mitigate overfitting without being too harsh. The momentum will be set to 0.9 as it is a typical value that can help speed up convergence in the optimization process. I will choose the Adam optimizer since it generally performs well for image classification tasks. The scheduler will be set to 'StepLR', which allows for scheduled learning rate decay, aiding in fine-tuning as training progresses. For local_epochs, setting it to 2 would provide a balance between training time and allowing the client to learn effectively on their dataset.

On the server side, I will mirror some optimally default values, using the same learning_rate, optimizer, and momentum to ensure consistency and effective global training dynamics. I will set the server scheduler to 'None' for simplicity in this round.

To align with the guidance suggesting that lower learning rates help during the image classification tasks, I will set the learning rate to 0.0003. The weight decay will be kept low at 0.0001, similar to Client 123, to avoid over-regularization, which can hinder learning in the early stages. I will opt for the same optimizer, AdamW, known for its efficiency with image data. The momentum is set to 0.9, a typical value that offers a good balance in convergence speed and stability. Given this is a medium-resource client, I will select a local epoch of 3 for more training iterations and a batch size in line with peer history, choosing 32 as a mid-range option. Dropout rate is suggested at 0.4, as it has been successfully utilized by others in similar tasks to help mitigate overfitting. For the server settings, I select parameters closely matching the client's own parameters, choosing a learning rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, and the same optimizer, AdamW.

The dropout rate will be increased slightly to 0.4, to further aid generalization and combat potential overfitting risks identified in training versus testing accuracies. The batch size will remain at 16 due to its historical performance and because it fits within the allowed parameters for the low-resource setup.

Lowering `learning_rate` to 0.0006 keeps it within client constraints while potentially reducing overfitting. Increasing `weight_decay` to 0.0006 enhances regularization and helps to avoid overfitting. The `momentum` remains at 0.9, which is stable and beneficial. The client's cluster capacity supports a `batch_size` of 128, and with the increasing `dropout_rate` to 0.4, it should mitigate overfitting further, favoring robustness in test accuracy. The server's configuration will remain consistent with an established, steady `learning_rate` at 0.001, aligned with successful configurations, with `mu` at 0.01 to maintain balance in FedProx.

However, looking at the peer's history of Client 245, who utilized a learning rate of 0.0002, a weight decay of 0.0005, and achieved a test accuracy of 76.11%, I will use this as a reference point. Given the medium-resource capacity of our client, a moderate `learning_rate` and `batch_size` will be employed. The `learning_rate` is set at 0.0002 to avoid aggressive updates. A moderate `weight_decay` of 0.0005 will help in regularization without excessively penalizing the weights, addressing any potential overfitting concerns due to the relatively complex nature of the ResNet18 model. The `momentum` will be set to 0.9 to accelerate gradients and effectively navigate through adverse local minima. I will select `AdamW` as the optimizer because it balances the benefits of adaptive learning rates with weight decay regularization. The `scheduler` uses `CosineAnnealingLR` to adapt the learning rate over epochs, ensuring smooth convergence. For `local_epochs`, I chose 2 to provide the model with sufficient iterations to learn from the local dataset without risking overfitting. A `batch_size` of 16 is optimal for medium-resource clients, ensuring more stable updates and manageable resource utilization, while a `dropout_rate` of 0.3 introduces regularization to combat overfitting in deeper architectures. For the server settings, I suggest the same learning rate of 0.001 based on consistency with the client and 0.9 momentum, utilizing `AdamW` for optimization and no learning rate scheduler to simplify the server-side training process.

Therefore, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0003 as it's the maximum allowed while still adhering to the 'lower learning rates for overfitting' guidance. The weight decay of 0.0001 is on the lower end, thus I will increase it to 0.0005 for better regularization, as the peer with the better performance had a weight decay of 0.0005. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is a good choice for stability. The optimizer 'AdamW' is performing well, and keeping the scheduler as 'CosineAnnealingLR' should benefit from adaptive learning rates over epochs. Local epochs of 2.0 and batch size of 16 were previously effective, remaining unchanged.

Weight decay is set to 0.0001 to apply a small amount of regularization, preventing overfitting without hindering the learning process. The momentum is set to 0.9, a standard choice for SGD that provides good convergence properties. I will choose the 'AdamW' optimizer, as it combines the benefits of Adam and weight decay, making it a robust choice for image data. I am opting for a scheduler of 'CosineAnnealingLR', which can help in potentially improving convergence over time by adjusting the learning rate. I select local_epochs as 2, which provides a balance between training adequately on client data and synchronizing with the server. The batch_size is selected as 64, which is manageable for a medium-resource client and provides a good gradient estimation. The dropout_rate is set at 0.2, a moderate value that can help with overfitting, especially in complex models like ResNet. For the server's learning rate, I also chose 0.001, aligning it with the client to maintain a consistent update strategy. Momentum remains at 0.9 and 'AdamW' is selected again for its effective optimization properties. The scheduler for the server is set to 'None' as no dynamic changes are necessary at this stage.

The weight decay will be set to 0.0001 to encourage regularization while fitting the model to the training data effectively. The momentum is retained at 0.9, which aligns with previous successful trials. I will switch the optimizer to AdamW as this has been used by peers with positive outcomes. The local epochs will remain at 2 since changes did not show significant issues and this value is within the allowed range. The batch size will be reduced to 24 to better fit within the medium client capacity and encourage better gradient estimations.

For the learning rate scheduler, I\u2019ll select 'CosineAnnealingLR' to adjust the learning rate over time, providing a smooth transition from exploration to convergence phases of training. I will allow 2 local epochs to strike a balance between training rigor and resource constraints, and a batch size of 32 is chosen, which is manageable given the medium-resource client capacity. I\u2019ll set the dropout rate at 0.2 to mitigate potential overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively. For the server-side parameters, I will match the client\u2019s learning rate and momentum for consistency in training dynamics, using the same optimizer to ensure the shared model receives smoothly adjusted updates during training. The server's scheduler will be set to 'None' as we focus more on the client's training dynamics for this initial round. Lastly, I will select mu = 0.01 as a moderate level of regularization to balance the influence of the FedProx component in federated training, aiding in model generalization.",

I will select a learning rate of 0.001, which is effective for image classification tasks. Regarding momentum, a value of 0.9 is commonly used and should provide good convergence properties. For the optimizer, I will choose Adam, as it dynamically adjusts learning rates and is generally effective in practice for CNNs.

The last two test accuracies (72.65% and 80.69%) indicate that weight decay may still be on the lower side, exemplifying that some regularization could help improve the model further. I suggest increasing the weight decay to 0.0005 to introduce a moderate amount of regularization. The model's performance history suggests stability with a momentum of 0.9, which I will retain. The 'Adam' optimizer has shown favorable results previously, so I will continue with it. The batch size was previously at 32; however, given medium resource constraints, I will adjust this down to 24. Considering the dropout rate was set to 0.2 before and achieved reasonable results, I will retain it as it presents a balance between regularization and learning capacity.

The 'momentum' will be set to 0.9, which is a standard choice for SGD optimizers, ensuring a good balance of updating direction in gradient descent. The 'optimizer' will also be set to 'SGD', which is currently preferred in peer success cases. The 'scheduler' will be set to 'None' as the peer strategy did not include it, and this will maintain simplicity.

Additionally, they set a weight_decay of 0.0001, which is effective for regularization, minimizing overfitting risk. The momentum was set to 0.9, a commonly used value that balances convergence speed and stability. The optimizer is SGD, a reasonable choice for this image classification task, as it provides good generalization. A batch size of 128 is selected based on the high-resource capacity of the client. The dropout rate is set at 0.25 to prevent overfitting without losing too much information from the model. We recommend 2 local_epochs to allow the model enough time to learn from the data without overfitting in this first round.

The test accuracy for previous hyperparameter settings fluctuated around the low 80% range, indicating a possible issue with overfitting, given that the model is complex (ResNet18) and may benefit from a higher weight decay for regularization. Thus, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to 5e-05 to help combat overfitting while keeping the learning rate fixed. The dropout rate will also be slightly increased to 0.4 based on peer experiences. Using the SGD optimizer remains optimal as shown in previous results. As for local_epochs and batch_size, I will retain them at 2 and 16 respectively, which appear to be stable. For the server parameters, the learning rate remains at 0.001, given its past effectiveness. I will also keep the momentum at 0.9 and continue with the 'SGD' optimizer since it has been stable, maintaining 'None' for the scheduler for simplicity in this low-resource context.

Therefore, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005 to maintain stability. Their weight decay of 0.0005 is also recommended for regularization, helping to prevent overfitting in potentially low training data contexts, so I will choose that as well. The momentum from both peers is consistent at 0.9, which provides some stability in SGD updates, so I will adopt that. The optimizer used by peers is Adam, which is well-suited for image classification tasks and will be the one I select. I will implement a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler, as seen in peer 85's approach, which could help adjust learning rates dynamically. Given the client's lower resource constraints, I will opt for a batch size of 16 and local epochs of 2. Additionally, I choose a dropout rate of 0.3 since it has been commonly used by peers to mitigate overfitting risk while preserving generalization capability.

For the client, a lower learning rate of 0.001 is chosen to ensure stable training for the low-resource clients, preventing oscillations. A weight decay of 0.0001 is sufficient for this group's regularization needs, while a momentum of 0.9 provides some inertia without being too aggressive. The Adam optimizer is selected for its adaptive learning capabilities, particularly beneficial in low-resource scenarios. A local_epochs value of 2 provides a balance between training time and performance enhancement. A batch size of 16 is manageable for the client's limited capabilities. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 strikes a balance between reducing overfitting and maintaining enough model capacity to learn effectively. For the server, similar principles apply with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 using the Adam optimizer to ensure consistent aggregation of model updates. I am choosing a scheduler of 'None' for simplicity given this is a first run and 'mu' is set to 0.01, a moderate value to introduce some level of proximal regularization without overwhelming the optimization step.",

For `weight_decay`, I settled on 0.0001 to provide a slight regularization effect without being too aggressive, which could impair learning; this value is at the lower end to encourage learning while still providing overhead for regularization. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that helps in stabilizing the velocity of descent in optimization. I opted for the `AdamW` optimizer since it generally offers better performance on image data compared to SGD, allowing for efficient weight updates. The `scheduler` is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually decrease the learning rate over epochs, aiding in convergence. I suggested a `local_epochs` value of 2, balancing the need for sufficient local learning while being efficient, and a `batch_size` of 16, small enough to suit the low-resource capability without sacrificing too much learning stability. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2, which should help mitigate potential overfitting on the low-resources immediately and avoid an overly aggressive regularization that could hinder learning. On the server side, I chose the same `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and `optimizer` as the client to maintain consistency, and set the `scheduler` to 'None' to avoid additional complexity given there are no previous rounds to learn from. Lastly, I set `mu` to 0.01, a middle-ground value that should effectively balance client updates without overly weighting any single client's contribution.",

This adjustment aims to improve convergence without risking significant instability. The weight decay has been set to 0.0001 to maintain regularization benefits without excessively penalizing the model weights. The momentum is kept at 0.9 as this has been effective in previous contexts. I selected the 'AdamW' optimizer because it combines adaptive learning with weight decay regularization, which is beneficial considering the classification nature of the task. The scheduler is kept as 'CosineAnnealingLR' which can help in refining training towards the end of the epochs. The local_epochs remain at 2 for stability, and I have chosen a batch size of 16, which is consistent with the prior selection. The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.3 to combat potential overfitting given the high previous accuracy. For the server parameters, I retained the learning rate at 0.0005 for consistency, which permits good updates while keeping a lid on fluctuations. The momentum remains at 0.9 to maintain performance. The optimizer and scheduler choices are consistent with those used in the client side, promoting harmonization in updates. The value for mu is set at 0.01 as it is well within the allowed range and can help maintain client participation balance in the SplitFed scheme.

Since last improvements came with higher weight_decay, I will set that at 0.0004 to help with potential overfitting from previous runs. Additionally, I will use Adam optimizer, as it has been consistently effective in prior configurations. Given the client's moderate resource level and the need to manage model complexity, I suggest a batch_size of 32, which has shown effectiveness in past configurations, alongside a local_epochs of 2 to maintain training efficiency without overloading resource capacity. The dropout_rate will be slightly higher than previous at 0.35 to further help regularization. For the server settings, maintaining the learning_rate at 0.0005 does not adhere to the constraints, so I will set it to 0.0003 for optimal performance while ensuring stability during updates.

Hence, I will adopt a similar learning rate for stability. The weight decay used by peer 249 is moderate (0.0007), suggesting that it is beneficial for clients as it helps regularize the model, thus I will also adopt this. Additionally, with a momentum of 0.9, peer 249 exhibited reasonable settings for stability which I will replicate. As this client is low-resource, the batch size should be smaller; therefore, I will select a batch size of 16, similar to peer client's choice. A dropout rate of 0.4 from peer 249 aims to reduce overfitting without excessive resource consumption, making it an apt choice. For the server, matching the learning rate and momentum decisions made for the client makes sense to sustain consistent learning dynamics across both.

A weight decay of 0.0001 is chosen to help with regularization without being overly restrictive, as we don't have signs of overfitting yet. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice in optimizers that can help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. For the local_epochs, I choose 2, balancing between sufficient training and resource constraints of the medium-resource client. The batch size is set to 64 as it offers a good trade-off between convergence speed and resource usage for the client's capacity. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is included to help mitigate any potential overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. On the server side, I mirror the learning rate and momentum, selecting 'Adam' as the optimizer and 'None' for the scheduler as we do not have a previous training history for adaptation. I choose mu to be 0.01 as it fits comfortably in the allowed range and allows some flexibility in the federated learning process.",

The previous test accuracy of 66.34% indicates that while there has been improvement, there is still room for adjustment, particularly considering the previous learning rates and their impact on performance. Given the client's low-resource capacity, it's essential to keep the learning rate on the lower end to ensure stable training. Thus, a learning rate of 0.0003 is optimal within the allowed range. The weight decay will be set slightly higher at 0.0006 to increase regularization, helping to manage any potential overfitting. The momentum is consistent with historical values at 0.9. The optimizer will remain as AdamW since it has been used effectively before. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.4 to further combat overfitting, based on peer experience suggesting success with similar values. Maintaining a batch size of 16 is acceptable, and local epochs are set to 2 to balance training duration and resource constraints. For the server, I will keep the learning rate for the server at 0.001, which has been stable, along with the momentum and optimizer values unchanged, and the scheduler set to None for simplicity. The proximal term (mu) will remain at 0.01, ensuring aligned training with regularization.

Increasing the weight decay slightly to 0.0006 will help with regularization due to potential overfitting, as we want to ensure that the model generalizes well on test data. The dropout rate is also increased from 0.3 to 0.4 based on the peer's successful use of a dropout rate that helped improve their accuracy. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', which has shown good performance in the past. The batch size is set to 128 since the client has the capacity to handle larger sizes. A conservative choice of local epochs at 2 balances the requirement for accurate training with efficient computation. For the server, stability in performance indicates that maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is appropriate, while also keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' for consistency with the past setup.

The previously used weight_decay of 0.0008 is effective, but to ensure better generalization, I will increase it slightly to 0.001, which aligns with the guidance on overfitting.

Given the performance of the model, I will maintain the AdamW optimizer due to its advanced capabilities in handling deeper networks like ResNet.

However, I will slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0002 to help mitigate potential overfitting, given that the accuracy has plateaued and another increase may not be beneficial. The dropout rate has shown improvement from 0.2 to 0.3; I'll keep it at 0.3 as it balances between retaining significant features and preventing overfitting. The batch size will remain at 32 due to the medium-resource cluster capacity. Additionally, since the client has not exhausted their capacity (local_epochs = 2.0), I will keep it the same. For the server parameters, the learning rate is kept at 0.001 and the optimizer at 'AdamW', aligning with previous configurations without causing any issues. Finally, the value for 'mu' is left at 0.01 to continue the regularization sweep without alteration, given that it's in the acceptable range.

The scheduler is set to 'None' as the client may benefit from maintaining a consistent learning rate given their limited capacity. I chose local_epochs as 3 and batch_size as 16 to capitalize on the limited iterations, which allows for more updates without overloading the client. The dropout_rate is set to 0.2 to help prevent overfitting without significantly impairing learning capacity in the early stages. For the server, I also set the learning_rate to 0.001, maintaining consistency across clients while fostering stable training.

Based on peer history, client 31's learning rate of 0.0005 and weight decay of 0.0001 is a good baseline since it helped achieve an 80.99% accuracy, and aligns with the guidance of adjusting for overfitting or underfitting. Thus, I will propose a learning rate of 0.0005, weight decay of 0.0001, using the AdamW optimizer for stability, and set a dropout rate of 0.3, which is a moderate value seen in other clients and can help in regularization without hampering learning. The local epochs are set to 2, similar to peer examples, and a batch size of 32 is optimal as it provides a balance between resource consumption and learning stability. For the server hyperparameters, I\u2019ll mirror the client\u2019s learning setup, using a learning rate of 0.001 to facilitate learning consistently across the federated setup.

The peers had varying success with learning rates of 0.0003 and 0.0005, leading to the conclusion that a moderate learning rate around 0.0005 would be effective for our client. Moderate learning rates help to avoid both underfitting and overfitting. The weight decay hyperparameter has helped peers achieve good accuracy without overfitting indicated by their learnings; therefore, I will set it to 0.0001 to start with regularization without impeding learning. Peer clients used a momentum of 0.9 effectively, which aligns with standard practices for SGD optimizers, so I\u2019ll stick to that. I will choose AdamW, as it is favorable for image classification tasks according to guidance. Considering I am not aware of the dataset behavior for the client yet, I will suggest a local_epochs of 2.0 as it seems to be a balanced choice among peers. A batch size of 32 is common and effective in their setups as well, fitting the medium-resource stipulation. Finally, I will set dropout_rate to 0.2, which has proven to work for peers while balancing the risk of overfitting. For the server, I will echo the client's learning rate of 0.001 as it aligns with the successful peer models and maintain a momentum of 0.9 with the same optimizer, AdamW. Lastly, I'll suggest no scheduler (None) for simplicity in this initial run as a complex scheduler may require further tuning that we don\u2019t have data on yet.

Given that both training and testing accuracies are currently unknown, a cautious approach should be taken. I will start with a moderate learning rate to prevent both overfitting and underfitting. A learning rate of 0.001 is optimal as it is generally recommended for image classification tasks and allows the model to converge without overshooting. For weight decay, I will set it to 1e-04, providing light regularization without being too harsh since there are no observed signs of overfitting yet. The momentum will be set to 0.9, a common choice that aids in smoothing out optimization paths. I will use 'AdamW' for the optimizer as it has shown great performance in image tasks due to its adaptive nature and ability to handle sparsity. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR' to gradually adjust the learning rate, promoting better convergence. As this is the first round, a local epochs value of 2 is reasonable, allowing the model to learn sufficiently without overloading the client. A batch size of 64 is selected, which is also a common practice for balancing training speed and model performance. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.3 is reasonable, adding regularization to mitigate overfitting risks as the model begins to learn. For the server, I will mirror the client\u2019s learning setup to ensure consistency during federated learning; hence the learning rate remains at 0.001, and the optimizer and scheduler are kept the same as the client's. The mu value should be set to 0.01 to maintain a healthy balance for FedProx regularization, ensuring client updates are stable while allowing reasonable adaptation.",

Increasing the weight_decay to 0.005 based on the recent fluctuations can also help mitigate overfitting concerns as seen in previous accuracy dips. Keeping the batch_size to 64 is not an option as only 32 or 48 are permitted; hence I will suggest batch_size as 32, matching with past configurations known to work in this context. The momentum will remain at 0.9 for stability. The optimizer will be SGD, which has consistently shown strong results in this scenario. A dropout_rate of 0.3 from the previous round will be maintained to aid generalization without being excessively conservative. On the server side, I will keep the learning_rate at 0.0005, as it is within range and allowed by the constraints, using SGD for optimization, which again seems to work better based on the client's history.

The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen for its ability to adapt learning rates for different parameters, which is often beneficial in the early stages of training. A `local_epochs` of 2 allows sufficient training time without overwhelming the client resources. The `dropout_rate` is set to 0.2 as a reasonable average to help prevent overfitting without losing too much valuable information. For the server, the learning rate is mirrored after the client at 0.001, momentum remains at 0.9, and 'Adam' is maintained as the optimizer due to its adaptability. The scheduler is set to 'None' for simplicity in this initial stage, allowing for a straightforward learning rate without complex adjustments.

This suggests there might be a need for some adjustments. Given the client's low-resource capacity, and to adhere to the identified trends: 1. The client's current learning rate is around 0.0003-0.0005, which is higher than our constraints (must be lower than or equal to 0.0002). Therefore, I will recommend a learning rate of 0.0002 to ensure stability. 2. The weight decay remains low (0.0001), thus I will set it at 0.0002 for better regularization as suggested in the guidelines. 3. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 is consistent with previous runs which have not shown issues. The optimizer will remain AdamW since it's effective for this task. 4. To maintain efficient training while staying within constraints, I will keep `batch_size` at 16, which has been used previously without indicating a problem in resource allocation. 5. The dropout rate was shifted from 0.2 to 0.3 in the last trial, achieving slightly better test accuracy.

For the server's parameters, I'll maintain similar values to what has been found effective: learning rate at 0.0005, keeping the same momentum and optimizer as the client.

The weight decay can be increased to 0.0008 for enhanced regularization, helping to combat possible overfitting. The current momentum of 0.9 will remain unchanged, as it has been consistently effective across the client's history. I will change the optimizer to 'SGD' as some peers have shown better test accuracy with this optimizer. The batch size will remain at 16 for stability, and I'll also increase the dropout rate to 0.4 to further alleviate any overfitting issues seen in prior rounds. For the server side, I will set the learning rate to 0.0002; this lower value allows for fine-tuning while keeping robustness. In terms of mu, a value of 0.01 is effective for recent runs, so I will keep it as is to maintain stability while leveraging the benefits of federated learning.",

The 'batch_size' will remain at 16 to match previous successful setups. The dropout rate stays at 0.4 to help manage overfitting tendencies noted from the high train accuracy seen in past trials. On the server side, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0002, which has also shown good performance in client history and aligns with the consistency needed for stability across federated learning.
