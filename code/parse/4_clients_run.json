A weight decay of 1e-05 is set to provide slight regularization and mitigate any risks of overfitting. The momentum is kept at 0.9 for stability, using the 'SGD' optimizer, which is generally effective for image classification tasks like ResNet18. Given the low resource context, I will set the local epochs to 2 with a batch size of 16, providing efficiency in training without overwhelming the client resources. I will set a dropout rate of 0.1 to prevent overfitting.

Given that the client is low-resource, I will decrease the batch size to 8 for better stability during training. A weight decay of 1e-05 is maintained to help with regularization without being too restrictive. The momentum is set to 0.9 based on previous settings. The optimizer will remain as SGD, which was previously used. For dropout, increasing it slightly to 0.2 can provide additional regularization, balancing between stability and performance.

I will adjust the dropout rate to 0.3, the maximum allowed, to counterbalance any potential overfitting when model capacity increases with the new learning rate.
