This learning rate will help avoid divergence issues often seen with higher values in low-resource environments. \n\nThe `weight_decay` is set to 0.0001, which provides some regularization without being too strong, considering this is the first round, and we want to avoid underfitting. \n\nFor `momentum`, I selected 0.9, which is a common and effective choice that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. \n\nI chose `optimizer` as 'AdamW', a robust option that combines the benefits of Adam with weight decay. This optimizer adapts the learning rate for each parameter, which can help in stabilizing training on low-resource setups. \n\nThe `scheduler` is set to 'None', given that we want to keep things simple for the initial run and monitor performance without dynamic adjustments. \n\nThe `local_epochs` is set to 3, allowing the client to train adequately within a single round, which is beneficial for learning-rich representations on CIFAR10. \n\nThe `batch_size` is set to 16, which is small enough to fit into the memory constraints of low-resource clients while still providing a reasonable update frequency. \n\nFinally, I've set the `dropout_rate` to 0.3, which is a moderate choice that can help mitigate overfitting without overly restricting the model's ability to learn. \n\nOn the server side, I’ve aligned the `learning_rate` at 0.001 and `momentum` at 0.9 for consistency. The optimizer remains 'AdamW', as it has already been justified for its efficacy. The `scheduler` is again set to 'None' to keep the initial setup straightforward. For the global parameter `mu`, I selected 0.01, which provides a moderate level of regularization in the federated context without being too aggressive.",

    "reasoning": "The client's previous configuration achieved a test accuracy of 49.12%. Given that this is relatively low for the task at hand, it indicates potential underfitting or inadequate training. To address this, I recommend optimizing hyperparameters as follows: For the client, we need a lower `learning_rate` to stabilize training, specifically a value of 0.0005, which is at the upper limit of the specified range but viable given the client's low-resource status. A `weight_decay` of 0.0001 is chosen to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effective features. I will retain the `momentum` at 0.9 and keep the optimizer as `AdamW`, as it typically performs well in image classification tasks. Since these clients may require a smaller `local_epochs`, I recommend 1 epoch along with a smaller `batch_size` of 8. The `dropout_rate` is upgraded slightly to 0.3 to mitigate potential overfitting as the model matures through training. On the server side, I propose setting the learning rate to 0.001, which enables better convergence for shared training across clients using `AdamW` as the optimizer. A `momentum` of 0.9 will assist in smoother updates. For the scheduler, using 'None' retains a straightforward learning rate without additional adjustments.

    "reasoning": "Given the client's low-resource context and previous test accuracy of 29.41%, it's crucial to adjust the hyperparameters strategically. The learning rate must be decreased as the previous value of 0.001 is relatively high for low-resource clients, which may lead to instability. Thus, I will set the learning rate to 0.0005, which is at the higher end of the allowed range but still conservative for stability. The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0001 to help mitigate overfitting given the low test accuracy, which suggests the model is struggling to generalize. Maintaining a momentum of 0.9 is beneficial for optimization. I will opt for the 'Adam' optimizer given its compatibility with adaptive learning, suitable for this scenario. The batch size will remain at 8, as this value is supportive yet not too large for the low-resource environment. The dropout rate will be adjusted slightly to 0.3, which is a reasonable amount to help prevent overfitting while accommodating the client's limited computational power. For the server-side, I will match the learning rate to 0.0005 for sync with client adjustments, maintain momentum at 0.9, and use 'Adam' as the optimizer to ensure stable weight updates.

Therefore, I will decrease the learning rate slightly to 0.0005 to promote stability and allow the model to focus more on this lower rate of change. Furthermore, since 0.001 is on the higher end of the available range for a learning rate, this adjustment is strategic to better fit the model to the training data. \n\nAdditionally, the `weight_decay` will be increased slightly to 0.0005 from 0.0001 in an effort to combat overfitting and to promote better generalization. For the `dropout_rate`, I will keep it at 0.3 as it is already helping in regularizing the model without excessive loss of information. Given the client's high resources, I will maintain a batch size of 64 and use 2 local epochs, which is a reasonable choice that balances training time and performance.  \n\nFor the server-side, I will align its learning rate with the client's learning rate of 0.0005 which is subtle enough for effective coordination in SplitFed without overwhelming the federated learning process. I'll set the `momentum` to 0.9 to match the existing configuration which has shown reasonable performance so far. As for the optimizer, continuing with 'AdamW' makes sense as it is proven to be effective.

Based on the recommendation for image classification, I opted for the Adam optimizer due to its adaptive nature, which is particularly beneficial for clients with limited resources. The weight_decay is set to 0.0001 to provide slight regularization since we have no evidence of overfitting so zeroing in on lower values seems optimal here right now.

I've selected a conservative learning rate of 0.001 to provide a stable start without risk of overshooting. The weight decay is set at 1e-05 to help with regularization, considering the moderate capacity of the client, while not excessively penalizing weight updates. I have chosen the SGD optimizer, which is well known for its robustness in image classification tasks. A momentum of 0.9 will help accelerate reducing oscillations and speed up convergence. The scheduler is set to 'None' for simplicity, allowing the initial learning rate to remain stable throughout this first run. Given that the client is a medium-resource entity, I'm opting for a local batch size of 32 and will run for 2 local epochs to give the model some training without overwhelming the capacity. A dropout rate of 0.2 is chosen to help mitigate overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. On the server side, the same learning rate and momentum have been selected to maintain consistency. The server will also utilize the SGD optimizer to help ensure coherence in the training approach.

Since the task is image classification on CIFAR-10, I will choose a moderate `learning_rate` of 0.001 which is known to provide a balance between convergence speed and stability. The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0001, which is a low value that supports regularization without being overly aggressive, especially important given that we do not have metrics to indicate overfitting yet. I will use `Adam` as the optimizer for its adaptive learning properties which can help stabilize training in the initial rounds. The `momentum` will be set to 0.9, a common value that helps acceleration along relevant directions in gradient descent while damping oscillations. For the `scheduler`, I will choose `None`, as it is often wise to start with no decay in the initial epochs until patterns in the learning can be understood. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2, providing sufficient training passes to learn the dataset without overwhelming the medium-resource client capacity. A `batch_size` of 32 strikes a good balance between resource usage and gradient estimation precision; it's a standard size that should work well for a medium-capacity client. Finally, I will select a dropout rate of 0.1 to introduce some regularization to combat potential overfitting without excessively hampering the learning process. For the server-side, I will mirror the client's choice of `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and `optimizer` to ensure consistency, and choose `None` for the `scheduler` as the starting point. The global parameter `mu` is set at 0.01, a middle-ground value that controls the FedProx regularization, ensuring it is impactful without being too aggressive.

Given this, we need to focus on hyperparameters that can enhance generalization (reduce overfitting) while adhering to the constraints. The learning rate of 0.001 might be a bit conservative due to the static nature of the context, so I propose using a slightly lower value. For this reason, I've selected a learning rate of 0.0005, which is the upper limit of the allowed range, to promote better learning. The weight decay will be set to 1e-04—a higher value—to help combat overfitting, which is indicated by the disparity in train/test accuracies (if they were observed). The momentum is kept at 0.9 as it has previously been effective and falls within the acceptable range. The optimizer will be changed to 'Adam' since it is known to efficiently minimize loss functions, especially in image tasks. The local epochs will be set to 2, given the cluster capacity. The batch size remains at 32, the maximum allowed, to maintain a balance between training speed and resource utilization. The dropout rate is increased to 0.3, which is still conservative, but should assist in regularization.

A weight decay of 0.0001 is proposed to provide some regularization without being too aggressive. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that often works well in practice to accelerate convergence. For batch size, I will select 64, as it is generally manageable within high-resource clients while allowing sufficient gradient updates. A dropout rate of 0.2 is introduced to combat potential overfitting. I will use local_epochs of 2 as it allows enough training on the local dataset without overcommitting resources. On the server side, I will mirror the client optimizer choices to maintain consistency across training while using a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum of 0.9. The scheduler will be set to 'None' to maintain a straightforward approach for this initial round. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01 as a standard value to gently apply the FedProx regularization without introducing too much constraint at this stage.",

Given that the clients in Cluster 2 are high-resource, they can handle larger batch sizes and learning rates. Considering the complexities involved in image classification and the potential for overfitting, I chose a moderate learning rate of 0.001, which is a good starting point that balances exploration and convergence. For weight decay, I selected a value of 0.0005 to apply some regularization while allowing the model to learn effectively. A momentum value of 0.9 is a standard choice, which can enhance convergence speed for the SGD optimization strategy. The use of the AdamW optimizer is preferred here due to its adaptive learning rate and strong performance in image-related tasks. I opted for the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler to adjust the learning rate dynamically, helping with training efficiency. The local_epochs are set to 3 as this helps the model to learn sufficiently without compromising convergence. A batch size of 64 is selected as it is optimal for high-resource clients, balancing between training stability and memory usage. Finally, a dropout rate of 0.3 is proposed to mitigate the risk of overfitting in this image classification task, especially with a powerful model like ResNet18.

However, as a high-resource client in Cluster 2, we can afford a more aggressive approach. The learning rate of 0.001 is a balanced choice, allowing for sufficient updates without risking instability. A weight decay of 0.0001 provides light regularization, which is beneficial given that the model is likely prone to overfitting on CIFAR-10. The momentum of 0.9 is a standard choice that can improve convergence speed. Given that batch sizes of 64 and 128 are feasible due to high resources, I select 64 to manage memory while ensuring a decent number of samples per update. The use of dropout at 0.1 is reasonable to aid in generalization without excessively disrupting training. For the server parameters, I mirrored the client’s optimizer and learning rate to ensure consistency in updates.

This can potentially result in faster convergence without significantly sacrificing stability. For weight decay, since the test accuracy is not extremely low compared to training accuracy, I will increase this to 0.0003 to better regularize and address potential overfitting, yet still remain within acceptable limits as per the constraints. A momentum of 0.9 is maintained as it is reliable for SGD-type optimizations. Considering the client's medium resources, I will retain the batch size at 64 and set local epochs to 2 to balance training time and resource usage effectively. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3, which helps mitigate overfitting. For the server side, I will set the learning rate to 0.001, a common choice for consistency and stability.

The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it proved effective without large fluctuations. The batch size will be set to 128 to utilize the client's high-resource capacity effectively, and the dropout rate will be adjusted to 0.3 to provide sufficient regularization without drastically impacting network training. For the server parameters, I will maintain a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 with 'AdamW' as it works well in the past, and set the scheduler to 'None' to avoid unnecessary complexity in the learning process. Finally, I will keep 'mu' at 0.01, which has shown adequate performance thus far. This configuration ensures I adhere to all constraints while optimizing performance based on prior history.",

The `weight_decay` is maintained at 0.0001, which is still low and could be increased to help combat overfitting; however, I will keep it to allow for more exploration during training.

In this low-resource environment, I'll opt for a `batch_size` of 16 and set `local_epochs` to 2, optimizing for stability while not stretching resources too thinly. The `dropout_rate` of 0.3 seems reasonable, but I will slightly increase it to 0.4 to further mitigate overfitting, based on the existing discrepancies between training and test accuracies.\nFor the server, I will set a similar learning rate of 0.001 as it functions well for coordination among clients.

For the server-side, I will align the learning rate and momentum with the client settings for consistency and stability during federated training, using a momentum value of 0.9.

Given that this client is a medium-resource client, utilizing a similar learning rate of 0.0001 will likely provide stability while training.

I will also set the local_epochs to 2, utilizing an average from peer local epochs while keeping in mind the client capacity.

Given that the weight decay was kept at 0.0005 and the learning rate at 0.0001, this suggests that the model might be underfitting, as well as having a relatively high test accuracy which shows signs of overfitting. The last successful peer achieved a higher test accuracy of 70.86% using a similar learning rate but a smaller batch size. This suggests we can squeeze a bit more out of the learning process. Therefore, I am lowering the learning rate to better fit within the smaller epsilon range of [0.0001, 5e-05], specifically using the steepest drop of 0.00005. For weight decay, I will increase it to 0.0007 to help with generalization and control overfitting. The selection of 'Adam' as the optimizer remains unchanged given its past strong performance. The momentum is also kept at 0.9, which has been stable for the client. As the model might benefit from an increased dropout rate, I will raise it to 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting while keeping it well within the 0.0-0.5 range. The batch size will be reduced to 32, based on peer success, ensuring that the model can fit within the medium-resource constraints and thus exploit deeper learning on this image classification task.

    "reasoning": "The task is an image classification problem using ResNet18 on the cifar10 dataset with low-resource clients. For such clients, it is advisable to use a lower learning rate and smaller batch sizes to ensure stable training. Given that this is the client's first round and there is no previous data to suggest specific learning rates or batch sizes that have worked, I will adopt a conservative approach for these hyperparameters. I recommend setting the learning_rate to 0.001, which is moderately low and within the allowed range, thereby allowing more stable convergence. The weight_decay is set to 1e-06 to avoid over-regularization due to the low-resource constraints. The momentum is set to 0.9, which commonly helps in stabilizing the training process with SGD-like optimizers. I chose 'SGD' as the optimizer, as it's a standard choice for image classification tasks, especially in CNN architectures, and should work effectively with the given batch size of 16—optimal for resource-constrained environments while still maintaining a good trade-off between speed and convergence. The dropout_rate is set at 0.2 to provide some regularization without hampering the learning too much. For the server parameters, I mirror the client's learning_rate and momentum for consistency across the federation and also choose 'SGD' as an optimizer, having a scheduler of 'None' since scheduling may not provide immediate benefits in the initial training rounds. Lastly, I set mu to 0.05, which falls within the permitted range and balances the regularization effects of FedProx without overwhelming the learning process.",

I suggest sticking with the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has worked previously, providing both efficiency and ease of tuning. The batch size of 32 is appropriate given the medium-resource configuration, allowing for reasonable computational efficiency.

For learning_rate, I selected 0.001, which is a conservative value that is neither too low (which might lead to underfitting) nor too high (which could lead to divergence). For weight_decay, I set it to 0.0005 to facilitate regularization, balancing loss and reducing overfitting risk, a common concern in early training phases. I opted for a momentum of 0.9, a typical value that helps with gradient descent convergence. The optimizer is set to 'AdamW' as it is frequently effective for CNNs, providing adaptive learning rate capabilities. A scheduler is set to 'CosineAnnealingLR,' which can help to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training, potentially improving convergence. The number of local_epochs is 2, allowing sufficient passes through the data without overfitting, while batch_size is set to 64, which balances memory efficiency and training speed on high-resource clients. The dropout_rate is set to 0.2 to prevent possible overfitting, which is crucial even though there's no previous history to indicate severe overfitting at this time. For the server-side, I used a similar learning rate (0.001) and momentum (0.9) to align with the client's setup for coherent training and synchronization. The same optimizer 'AdamW' and 'None' for scheduler ensures consistency and stability.

The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0002 to combat possible overfitting, aligning with the guidance indicating that more regularization may help in such cases. Since it's a low-resource client, I will also keep the batch_size small at 16, as smaller batches can lead to more stable training with fewer resources. The momentum will remain at 0.9 since it has been effective, and AdamW is a robust choice for the optimizer as it improves on Adam by incorporating weight decay. The local_epochs will stay at 2 to provide a balance between training time and performance. The dropout_rate will be slightly increased to 0.3 to further mitigate overfitting. For the server parameters, the learning_rate will also be set to 0.0005 to match the client's adjustments for consistent behavior and optimization, alongside a stable optimizer choice of AdamW and maintaining a momentum of 0.9 as this has been effective in previous attempts.

The momentum (0.9) remains appropriate since both the client's and peer’s performance demonstrate reasonable convergence speeds. I will stick with the AdamW optimizer as it has shown good results for image classification tasks in modern neural networks. The local_epochs remain at 2 to balance performance and convergence stability. I will also keep the batch_size at 64, which is compliant with previous utilization. Lastly, I propose increasing the dropout_rate slightly to 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting in light of the training-to-test accuracy gap. On the server side, I will retain the learning_rate at 0.0005 and momentum at 0.9 for consistent training dynamics in line with peer practices, maintaining the optimizer at AdamW and scheduler as None for flexibility in updates. The regularization factor, mu, is set to 0.01 to align with recent peer values and provide a sound balance in federated training. Overall, I aim to slightly conservative adjustments while adhering to the constraints.",

This suggests a reasonable level of performance, but there is still room for improvement. Since the test accuracy is notably less than what could be improved, we may be dealing with a slight overfitting scenario, as indicated by the test accuracy being less than optimal compared to the client's expectations. To address this, I will suggest increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.001 to help regularize the model and prevent overfitting. The learning rate of 0.001 is already an acceptable mid-range value for training, but since we want to optimize further and because previous suggestions assume a strong performance, I will slightly lower it to 0.0007 to optimize convergence in the federated learning setting. For the optimizer, I will switch from 'AdamW' to 'SGD' to emphasize stability in convergence on this resource-rich client setup, as SGD can provide different properties on convergence, especially with a decently tuned learning rate. Regarding the batch size, I will use 256 to take advantage of the cluster's capabilities and potentially speed up training throughput. As for the dropout_rate, I increase it to 0.3 to add further regularization. Overall, these changes are in alignment with the guidance for addressing potential overfitting and optimizing for the federated schema. For the server, I will suggest maintaining a similar learning rate as the client at 0.001 for stability while using the SGD optimizer to ensure consistency.

Client 485 successfully used a small learning_rate of 0.0005, which suited their low-resource condition and achieved a good accuracy. Therefore, I will implement the same learning rate of 0.0005 for the client to ensure stable training. For weight_decay, I will use 0.0005, which is moderate and has potential for good regularization without the risk of overfitting. I will set momentum to 0.9 as it is a common effective value providing acceleration in SGD-like methods. The optimizer will be 'AdamW', as it is known for handling learning rates dynamically well, especially in resource-limited scenarios. The scheduler will remain 'None' to avoid complicating learning rate adjustments initially; this helps with stability. Regarding local_epochs, I will set it to 2, which seems reasonable for gathering sufficient updates while considering the low-resource context. For batch_size, I will use 16, aligning with peer strategy and ensuring that the updates during training are stable without overwhelming client resources. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.3 is a good choice to prevent potential overfitting while enabling the model to learn effectively. For the server settings, I will align the server's learning rate to 0.001, a straightforward increase facilitating coordination with the client's batch training. I will keep the optimizer as 'AdamW' maintaining consistency with the client's choice, momentum remains at 0.9, and I will also keep the scheduler as 'None'.

However, the client is operating at the upper limit of the learning rate at 0.0005. Since we're aiming for potential improvement based on the guidance, I'll decrease the learning rate to 0.0003 to allow finer tuning of the weights without overshooting optimal values. The weight_decay will be increased slightly to 0.0008, which is still within the allowed range and could help mitigate any risk of overfitting. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' due to historical consistency and success, while the momentum will be increased to 0.95 for faster convergence. The drop rate will stay at 0.3, which seems to be a good balance, and the batch size will be kept at 32 since it's not among the allowed values and adjustments must adhere to constraints, so I'll use 16, which is the closest fitting option. Lastly, I'll set `mu` to 0.01, which is valuable for controlling the FedProx regularization in the federated scheme without significant deviation from the last round's performance.

The local_epochs will be kept at 2, a moderate choice for convergence, and the batch_size will remain at 16 as it balances memory constraints and training data availability effectively. The dropout_rate will increase slightly to 0.35 to further mitigate overfitting risks.

The batch size will remain at 32, as it balances training efficiency and computational resource. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3, as this can help in reducing overfit further while still providing adequate capacity for learning.

A momentum of 0.9 is standard for momentum-based optimizers to speed up training without sacrificing convergence. The 'AdamW' optimizer is chosen for its efficiency in handling sparse gradients and its adaptive learning rate capabilities. For the training schedule, I will use the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler, as it has been shown to be effective in gradually decreasing the learning rate, which can improve model performance toward the end of the training. I will set the local_epochs to 2, which allows for a reasonable number of updates without overwhelming the computation but also allows learning from the identified local dataset. A batch size of 64 is also practical given the high resource capability of this client. Lastly, a dropout rate of 0.2 is selected; while not the maximum, it provides a balance between regularization and learning, helping to prevent overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively.",

I will set `learning_rate` to the maximum allowable value of 0.0003 within the constraints to provide some responsiveness in learning while still being conservative.

The task is image classification using ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Guidance indicates that the choice of learning rate and optimizer can greatly impact model performance. Additionally, as this client belongs to a medium-resource cluster, a conservative approach is necessary for `batch_size` and `learning_rate`.\n\nTo avoid both overfitting and underfitting issues (since there's no prior training performance data), I will set a moderately low learning rate of 0.001, which is well within the constraints and commonly used in practice. I will choose `AdamW` as the optimizer as it's typically effective for image classification tasks while providing good performance on a variety of datasets. I plan to use a `weight_decay` of 0.0001 for regularization, as it's a conservative approach that can help mitigate overfitting without being too aggressive given the medium resources. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, which is a standard for most SGD-based optimizers, helping to accelerate convergence.\n\nConsidering the medium-resource capacity of the client, I will suggest a `local_epochs` value of 2 which provides a good trade-off between training time and convergence. A `batch_size` of 32 is a reasonable choice as it balances memory consumption and gradient variance. Lastly, I will set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2, as it is a common practice for CNNs to prevent overfitting in deeper networks while still allowing the model to learn effectively.\n\nFor the server parameters, I will align them closely with the client's settings to maintain consistency. A server `learning_rate` of 0.001 will be used, followed by the same optimizer choice of `AdamW` and a momentum of 0.9 to ensure synchronization in the training process. I will select 'None' for the scheduler since a simple constant learning rate might serve well with the current settings.

In Epoch 13, a lower learning rate of 0.0005 yielded a significant increase in test accuracy to 69.32% compared to 49.80% at a higher rate of 0.001. Thus, I need to propose a lower learning rate, continuing the decreasing trend to promote further model tuning while respecting the strict constraints. Setting the learning rate to 0.0003 provides a good balance without exceeding limits. The weight decay is also increased to the maximum allowable value of 0.001 to counteract potential overfitting observed in earlier runs. The momentum is retained at 0.9, as previous configurations seem to benefit from this value. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' since it has shown positive results. The local epochs stay at 2, and the batch size is kept at 32 due to past usage; however, I must reduce it to the allowed 16 for this step. Lastly, to give the model a better chance to generalize, I’ll increase dropout_rate to 0.4. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 as it's within allowed limits and has worked effectively, maintaining momentum at 0.9 and sticking to the 'AdamW' optimizer with no scheduler adjustments for simplicity in this round.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round, there's no prior performance data to guide specific tuning directly. However, we can draw insights from the peer's historical performance. Client 446 utilized a learning rate of 0.0001 with a weight decay of 0.0005, and achieved a 52.18% accuracy. To optimize our chances based on their results while considering a medium-resource classification context, I recommend starting with a slightly higher learning rate to encourage learning, leading to an effective value of 0.0005. A weight_decay of 0.0005 can also be used as it matches that of the peer, helping to mitigate potential overfitting. The momentum parameter will be set to 0.9, which is commonly effective and aligns with peers. The optimizer `AdamW` is selected due to its adaptability in handling weight decay. A reasonable dropout rate of 0.1 reflects our commitment to prevent overfitting without excessively harming model capacity. As for local_epochs, a value of 2 offers a balanced training duration for the limited setup. A smaller batch size of 16 is chosen in accordance with the medium-resource designation. For the server configuration, I will replicate the client's optimizer and set a learning rate and momentum that encourage convergence, specifically set at 0.001 and 0.9 respectively.

Given that their test accuracy is reasonable but likely not improved further due to a learning rate that is too high for their set constraints, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0003 to encourage better convergence without overshooting minima. The weight decay of 0.0005 is within the allowed range and supports regularization without significant risk of underfitting, so I will keep it the same.

Therefore, I will choose a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0003. This rate remains conservative, allowing for a controlled change while potentially avoiding issues related to overfitting, as previously seen with the client's higher learning rates. To enhance regularization due to the observed overfitting risk, I will increase the weight decay to 0.0006, as the upper limit is still manageable within the specified range. The client has found momentum at 0.9 to be a stable choice, so I will keep it unchanged. The optimizer will be 'AdamW', as it is known to work well in scenarios like this, especially for image data. Given the best previous performance at 256 batch size, I will opt for the largest value provided to maximize the learning process in this high-resource client scenario. The dropout rate will be set at 0.4 to further combat overfitting, which was indicated by the higher training accuracy compared to testing performances. For the server, the same learning rate of 0.0005 is advisable for coordination consistency but is slightly reduced from the client's due to needing stable relays among clients. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW' will reduce discrepancies within the system. The momentum remains at 0.9, maintaining the client's previous momentum analysis.

Increasing the weight decay from 0.0005 to 0.0007 should help with regularization as well, especially in conjunction with the higher dropout rate to combat potential overfitting. The batch size of 128 is reasonable considering it's a high-resource client, and increasing it to 256 could improve training efficiency while still manageable for the client. Local epochs will stay at 2 to allow sufficient training without increasing the risk of overfitting. The FedProx regularization parameter `mu` will remain at 0.01, as there seems to be no indication to alter it based on the peer analysis.

    "reasoning": "The client's last run showed a test accuracy of 69.90%, which indicates that there is room for improvement, primarily because we are not achieving the desired performance on the test set. Given that we are focused on the CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet18, we need to address potential overfitting, especially since the client's training accuracy history is high, correlating with overfitting issues. To tackle this, I will increase the weight_decay to enhance regularization and mitigate overfitting. Based on the constraints and the client history, I suggest using a weight_decay of 0.0005, keeping it within the specified limits and offering stronger regularization. The learning_rate will be set at the maximum of 0.0005 to provide a more aggressive update strategy initially and possibly help escape local minima effectively. I am also choosing 'Adam' as the optimizer, as it has been effective in past implementations and is known for its adaptive capabilities. To better balance performance, I will opt for a batch_size of 32, which is a standard choice; however, since it's not in the constraints, I will adjust to the closest smaller option of 24. Also, a local_epoch of 2 is reasonable since it provides a good balance between convergence speed and avoiding excessive overfitting. Lastly, the dropout_rate is adjusted to 0.2, providing additional regularization without being too aggressive. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client's learning_rate at 0.0005, use 'Adam' as a familiar optimizer to the client, and stick with 'None' for the scheduler since it appears no scheduling was effective in past trials. The mu value will be kept at 0.01 to maintain consistency with previous configurations while ensuring proper FedProx regularization.",

Client 403 utilized a learning rate of 0.0005 and achieved a good test accuracy of 74.56%. Given that the client has high resources, we can afford to utilize a slightly higher learning rate while still being within the safe threshold. Hence, I am selecting a learning rate of 0.001. We also note that Client 403 used a weight decay of 0.0005, which generally helps combat overfitting without diminishing learning capacity, so I will apply the same here for consistency. The momentum will be set to 0.9, consistent with both the peer's settings and typical effective values. The optimizer selected will be AdamW, as it's popular for image classification tasks and was used successfully by Client 403. The scheduler will be 'CosineAnnealingLR', allowing for gradual adjustments to the learning rate during training, which has been a common practice for effective training. A local epoch of 2 is chosen as the peer used this value and since the client has the capacity for high resource load, it's viable. A batch size of 128 was also used by Client 403 and seems ideal for high-resource clients, allowing for efficient gradient updates. Lastly, I will set the dropout rate to 0.3 to mitigate the risk of overfitting, as indicated by the common practice in similar tasks. For the server settings, I will mirror the client's learning rate, momentum, and optimizer settings to maintain consistency across the model training. The mu value will be set at 0.05, in line with a reasonable regularization parameter per the guidance while also reflecting the peer's values.

The immediate peer comparison (`Client 403 achieved 74.56% with a lower learning_rate of 0.0005`) indicates that a reduction in learning rate could enhance generalization. Therefore, selecting `learning_rate: 0.0005` while adhering to the strict constraints is a reasonable step. The `weight_decay` will be set to `0.0005`, consistent with the peer's settings which may help regularize the model without drastic changes. The `momentum` is maintained at `0.9`, which is standard and effective in optimizing CNN architectures like ResNet. I will retain the `optimizer` as 'AdamW' and the `scheduler` as 'CosineAnnealingLR', as they are established choices that align with the client's capabilities. The `local_epochs` remains at `2`, allowing for an adequate number of weight updates during training without requiring excessive resources. The `batch_size` of `128` is retained, consistent with previous settings, to ensure stability. Finally, I will increase the `dropout_rate` to `0.4`, as it can further mitigate overfitting and improve test accuracy. The server side will keep `learning_rate: 0.001` and `momentum: 0.9` to maintain consistency with previous trials, which functioned effectively, while keeping the `scheduler` as 'None' to reduce complexity.

Finally, the dropout rate is set to 0.3, balancing regularization potential while retaining model capacity. For the server, I will mirror the client's choice of learning rate and momentum while also using AdamW, with 'None' for the scheduler for alignment.

To further refine the model's performance while adhering to the constraints, I will set the learning_rate to 0.0003, which is towards the upper limit of the allowed range and may help the model learn faster without causing instability. I will increase the weight_decay to 0.0005 which can help with overfitting since the test accuracy is not significantly higher than the training accuracy. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 will ensure consistent updates. I will stick with 'AdamW' optimizer as it has worked in the past sessions. Increasing the dropout_rate to 0.4 will further help in regularizing the model since high discrepancies between training and test accuracy are often indicative of overfitting. For the local_epochs, I will maintain it at 2, which balances training and resource consumption. The batch_size is suitably kept at 32, which is within the mid-range for efficient training in the given hardware context.

Notably, Clients 16, 111, and 437 all used a learning rate of 0.0005, which appears to stabilize training in the CIFAR-10 image classification task, given their accuracy results. To ensure comparable performance, I'm suggesting the same `learning_rate` of 0.0005. The `weight_decay` has been effective at 0.0005 to 0.0008 among peers, and given the moderate capacity of the client, I will set it carefully at 0.0005 to help with regularization without risking underfitting. The `momentum` value of 0.9 has been consistent across excellent-performing peers, and I will keep this value. The optimizer choice of 'AdamW' has been seemingly beneficial too. For the `local_epochs`, I will choose 2, as observed with peers, to prevent over-training while still allowing adequate iterations. The `batch_size` is set to 32 to balance computational efficiency with convergence quality, following what others have used. The `dropout_rate` is set at 0.3 which correlates with high training accuracy but helps prevent overfitting as indicated by peer experiences. For the server-side, I will align the `learning_rate` to 0.001, slightly higher than the client but still manageable, alongside the same `momentum` and optimizer to maintain consistency throughout the training environment.

The learning rate of 0.0005 is placing us on the lower end, according to both the client's and peers' histories where they tested values around this range and didn't improve significantly. As a precaution against underfitting, I will suggest a lower learning rate of 0.0003, which should keep the model learning effectively without overshooting. The weight decay, currently at 0.0005, is reasonable to mitigate overfitting; however, since the test accuracies are decent, I will retain it and make it slightly lower at 0.0004 to balance the learning and regularization. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as it has proven effective across peers. The optimizer of 'AdamW' remains consistent as it yields effective results in this case, maintaining the learning rate structure. I've chosen to increase the local epochs to 3 since increasing training time generally helps model performance, and the batch size will be maintained at 32, as resource limits are moderate. The dropout rate will be slightly adjusted to 0.4 for increased regularization without overwhelming the learning process. On the server side, retaining the learning rate at 0.0005 works to ensure the model is trained synchronously and safely with the client. A momentum of 0.9 will be maintained to stabilize training.

The learning rate must be reduced since the client is using a 'low-resource' cluster, necessitating stability. Therefore, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0005. The weight decay is currently at 0.0001 and can be increased to 0.0005 to introduce stronger regularization, as the test accuracy is low relative to the potential of the model. A momentum of 0.9 is kept, as it's a reasonable choice for AdamW. The optimizer, AdamW, performs well for ResNet and image classification tasks, and I will retain it. The scheduler will be set to 'StepLR' to help potentially adjust the learning rate dynamically and improve convergence. For local epochs, I will choose 2, balancing between training time and performance improvements. The batch size of 16 is already optimal for the client's resource constraints, so no change is needed. Finally, I will opt for a dropout rate of 0.3 to further help mitigate potential overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training. For the server parameters, I'll mirror the learning rate of 0.0005 used by the client for consistency, with a momentum of 0.9 and the optimizer 'AdamW.'

However, consulting the expert guidance is crucial. Since we are dealing with a classification task (ResNet18 on CIFAR10), key hyperparameters that impact performance are the learning rate and optimizer. As the client operates in a medium-resource cluster, we want to adopt a balanced approach. I will select a moderate learning rate of 0.001 to facilitate suitable convergence, as higher rates could lead to unstable training and lower may cause underfitting. Weight decay will be set to 0.0001 to add regularization without being too aggressive—considering potential overfitting typical in image tasks. The momentum will be set to 0.9, providing a good balance between momentum and responsiveness. AdamW is chosen as the optimizer due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which suits varying training conditions. For the batch size, I select 32, which is a reasonable choice that balances between memory constraints and sufficient training data per update. Dropout is set at 0.3 to help mitigate overfitting while still allowing for effective learning.

The scheduler is 'None' because, as this is the initial round, it is better to monitor performance before implementing learning rate adjustments through scheduling. I will use a local_epochs of 2, which provides a balance between computational efficiency and thorough training, and a batch_size of 64, suitable for high-resource clients. Lastly, the dropout_rate is set to 0.25, which is a moderate value to help with possible overfitting without overly reducing model capacity.\n\nFor the server parameters, I will also set the learning_rate to 0.001 as consistency between client and server is often beneficial for efficient communication in federated learning setups. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 for the same reasons related to convergence. I will retain the 'AdamW' optimizer for the server as well for optimized performance in this federated setting. The scheduler is set to 'None' as there is no prior data from previous rounds to guide scheduling decisions at this stage. Lastly, I will set mu to 0.01, which is a reasonable choice to regulate the regularization effects of FedProx without overly constraining the local training process.",

Additionally, I will increase the weight decay to 0.0007 to combat potential overfitting, as the guidance states that increasing weight decay can be beneficial when training accuracy is much higher than test accuracy. I will keep the momentum at 0.9, consistent with their previous successful setup. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' since it has been working well and is among the pre-approved options. The batch size will be increased to 256, which is suitable for high-resource clients, allowing more data to be processed at each step, leading to potentially faster convergence. The dropout rate will be slightly increased to 0.3, enhancing regularization to avoid overfitting.

The previous weight decay of 0.0005 is appropriate for regularization, so I will maintain it.

The batch size of 128 is suitable for a high-resource client and manageable for ResNet18, so I will keep it, and the local epochs at 2 since it balances the training time and effectiveness well.

The momentum will remain at 0.9 to maintain stability during training. Meanwhile, I will keep the optimizer as AdamW because it is a well-regarded choice for ResNet models and has performed decently in the past.

I will suggest a batch_size of 32, which is a solid middle ground for this resource level. Lastly, a dropout_rate of 0.25 is chosen since it is on the higher end of the allowed range and can help further mitigate overfitting if present. For the server configuration, keeping the learning_rate at 0.001 with the AdamW optimizer and no scheduler aligns with the previous successful runs, while the momentum at 0.9 should ensure strong consistency and convergence.

This suggests that the previous settings were generally effective, but I need to make adjustments within the constraints for further improvement. The client is currently using a learning rate at the higher bound of the specified range. Given the better performance, I will decrease it slightly to 0.0003 to ensure we are operating below the previous threshold, as a lower learning rate may help in fine-tuning the model without overshooting the optimal solution. The weight decay is also set at the higher boundary of the recommended range (0.0005). I'll increase it to 0.0005, which will add more regularization and mitigate overfitting risks. For the dropout rate, I will increase it slightly to 0.4, as it can help address overfitting by providing regularization. The momentum is set to 0.9, which is commonly effective, so I will retain that. The optimizer remains as SGD, as it has been used successfully in previous configurations.

Since the test accuracy indicates good performance at 74.86% but with potential risk of overfitting, we will reduce the learning rate slightly to 0.0005 to help settle the model into a more optimal region. This also fits within the constraints and leverages potential for improvement without losing significant momentum on learning. The weight decay was set at 0.0001, which can be raised for regularization, helping to reduce overfitting; I will increase it to 0.0005. The momentum remains at 0.9, which is a solid choice based on common practice for optimizing ResNet architectures. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW' since it is already proven in this context, and I will stick with no scheduler as it's presently 'None'. A batch size of 64 is employed for stability given the powerful constraints of the client, along with a dropout rate of 0.3 to help regularize the model further against overfitting in line with the observed training characteristics. The increase of local epochs to 3 should allow for more thorough training without risking overfitting, given the power of the client's capacity. For server parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 to provide consistency in learning without introducing further variance and choose 'AdamW' consistent with client settings and 'None' for the scheduler to maintain simplicity.

The server parameters will mirror the client's, maintaining a consistent training experience, with a learning rate of 0.0004, momentum of 0.9, and using 'AdamW'.

A learning_rate of 0.001 strikes a balance between convergence speed and stability. The weight_decay is set at 0.0001 to provide slight regularization without overwhelming the model, considering the model complexity of ResNet18. The momentum is set at 0.9, a standard value that may help accelerate gradients in the right direction during training. The optimizer choice is 'Adam' due to its adaptive learning capabilities, beneficial for image classification problems. I will apply 'StepLR' as the scheduler to reduce the learning rate at fixed intervals, thereby allowing the model to fine-tune over epochs while preventing overfitting later on. A local_epochs value of 2 is chosen for a good trade-off between training time and model performance. A batch_size of 64 is suitable for the medium-resource client, optimizing training efficiency. Lastly, the dropout_rate is set to 0.1 to aid with regularization and prevent overfitting.

Given that there is no prior performance data to suggest high or low learning rates, a moderate learning rate is sensible. I will start with a learning_rate of 0.001, as this is robust for initial experiments. A weight_decay of 1e-04 helps with regularization, which can be important for avoiding overfitting on CIFAR10. A momentum value of 0.9 is selected as it is commonly effective in stabilizing SGD optimizations. The optimizer 'Adam' is chosen due to its adaptiveness, which can help with a variety of image dataset tasks including CIFAR10. In this case, I will not specify a learning rate scheduler to keep the process straightforward (scheduler value is 'None'). A local_epochs value of 3 allows for sufficient training on the client side given their medium-resource capacity. I select a batch_size of 32, which optimally fits within the specified constraints for medium-resource clients. A dropout_rate of 0.1 will help prevent potential overfitting while giving the model enough capacity to learn useful representations.\n\nFor the server parameters, I will match the client with a slightly conservative learning_rate of 0.001 and retain the momentum at 0.9 with the 'Adam' optimizer for consistency. A scheduler is not necessary at the server level so 'None' is appropriate.

    "reasoning": "The client has a history of achieving 74.68% test accuracy with a learning rate of 0.001. The test accuracy is relatively strong but implies potential for improvement given that the impact of weight decay hasn't been explicitly tested yet. Since the test accuracy is lower than what could be expected from the training accuracy, a higher `weight_decay` might be beneficial to combat any possible overfitting. Thus, I set `weight_decay` to 0.0005, which is on the higher end of the specified range. The `momentum` of 0.9 is retained for stability in the optimization path, which is consistent with best practices. Choosing the `optimizer`, I switched to 'AdamW' from 'Adam' due to its better performance in training deep networks and its adaptive learning rate feature, which is valuable in image classification tasks. The `scheduler` is set to 'StepLR' to progressively reduce the learning rate during training for improved convergence. For `local_epochs`, I retained a value of 2, as it's a good balance given the cluster's medium capacity. The `batch_size` remains at 64 as it has shown effectiveness in previous runs. The `dropout_rate` is slightly increased to 0.2 to help reduce overfitting while still being within the constraints. For the server, the learning rate is maintained at 0.001, `momentum` is again at 0.9 for consistency, the optimizer stays as 'AdamW', and the scheduler remains 'None' for simplicity and stability.

However, since the client is in Cluster 2 (High-Resource), we can utilize aggressive hyperparameters that take advantage of this capacity. I will set the learning_rate at 0.005, which is moderate enough for stability yet aggressive enough to promote learning in this image classification task. For the optimizer, I chose 'AdamW' because it usually helps with sparse data and provides good generalization. The momentum is set to 0.9, a common choice that often aids convergence without risking instability. For weight_decay, I will use 0.0005 to apply a slight regularization pressure to combat potential overfitting, given that we’re training on CIFAR-10. I suggest using a batch_size of 64, which is reasonable for high-resource clients, ensuring efficient training per update. The dropout_rate is set at 0.2 to add a regularization effect without sacrificing too much model capacity. For local_epochs, I will go with 2 to allow for ample training per federated round without overloading the client. On the server side, I will mirror the client’s learning_rate and momentum in order to ensure consistency in model updates, using 'AdamW' for the optimizer as well.

I recommend starting with a learning rate of 0.001, which is a common starting point for image classification tasks, balancing stability and convergence speed.

The momentum will be set at 0.9, a standard value that works well in practice. The batch size will be set to 64, allowing for effective training while maintaining memory efficiency. A dropout rate of 0.1 is chosen to help prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the inputs to 0 during training. For the server, I will mirror the client's optimizer choice and set the learning rate at 0.001 and momentum at 0.9 for consistency.

Given that the client's dropout rate of 0.2 might not be sufficiently high to combat possible overfitting, I will increase it to 0.3.

I'll set the learning rate to 0.0003 while maintaining a slightly higher weight decay at 0.0004 to combat possible overfitting, given that the training accuracy might be better than the testing accuracy.

The dropout rate is slightly increased to 0.4 to further help mitigate overfitting risks especially since the model already appears to be at risk of overfitting.

The `optimizer` will be `AdamW`, which is commonly effective for image tasks.

The momentum remains at 0.9, as it has worked well in the past. For the optimizer, I will continue to use AdamW because it has a robust track record in image classification tasks. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3 to further combat overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. Given the strong hardware of the client, a batch_size of 64 is appropriate. The local_epochs will remain at 2, which balances between computation time and model convergence speed.

    "reasoning": "Given the client's test accuracy of 80.71%, there is a potential slight overfitting as the accuracy is decent but could possibly be improved. I will suggest a lower learning_rate of 0.0004 to help mitigate this and encourage better generalization. Considering the trade-off between convergence speed and performance, I believe this learning rate is optimal based on the history. The weight_decay will be increased to 0.0005 (still within constraints) to add regularization and possibly help with overfitting, following the pattern observed in similar settings. The client's momentum remains at 0.9 to benefit from momentum's effect on convergence speed. I will maintain the 'Adam' optimizer as it has been more effective in previous training phases according to common practices in the historical context. The batch_size of 64 stays consistent with previous settings as it efficiently utilizes client resources without overwhelming them. The local_epochs is kept at 2.0 to balance between training time and model stability. The dropout_rate will be slightly reduced to 0.2 since it was previously aiding the model without overly penalizing neurons. For the server, I will mirror the learning_rate to maintain uniformity at 0.0005, with the 'SGD' optimizer as a standard because it can stabilize updates. The momentum on the server side will again be kept at 0.9, ensuring synchronization with the client's settings. Lastly, I will set mu at 0.01 to align with previous implementations and expected regularization without introducing excessive variability.",

Additionally, considering peer performance, Client 227 achieved the best accuracy of 78.62% using a learning rate of 0.0005, which indicates we can adopt a slightly lower learning rate with careful regularization. Given that the previous test accuracy was still somewhat competitive with 0.005, I will use a learning rate of 0.001 for better convergence stability without risking the chances of overfitting. Since both high training and low testing accuracies imply overfitting as per the previous determination, I will increase weight_decay to 0.0008 for better regularization. The drop rate was effectively tested at 0.3, indicating a need for slight adjustments towards generalization, but I will raise it to 0.4 similar to peers achieving under the same conditions, to further combat overfitting.

The `dropout_rate` was kept constant at 0.3 in previous configurations, but I will try a slightly higher rate of 0.35 to find any improvement in generalization while adhering to the strictly allowed range. The `batch_size` remains optimal at 256 for the client’s capacity.

The previous use of a low learning rate (0.0005) resulted in decent performance, but there is potential for improvement by increasing the learning rate slightly to balance feature extraction and convergence speed. The higher learning rate (0.0007) remains well within limits and can help improve training speed without inducing too much instability. The weight decay is slightly increased to 0.0006 to mitigate any potential overfitting observed in previous rounds while staying within the acceptable range. The dropout rate is kept at 0.4 to maintain some regularization, as it has shown benefits in terms of overfitting reduction.

For `weight_decay`, I will increase it to 0.0005 to introduce more regularization aimed at reducing overfitting. Keeping the `momentum` unchanged at 0.9 is beneficial for convergence stability. The optimizer will remain as 'AdamW', as it's known to work well with image classification tasks. A `dropout_rate` of 0.2 offers a balance for regularization without sacrificing model capacity. For the server, I will also set `learning_rate` to 0.0005 for similar reasons, with `momentum` remaining at 0.9, and using 'AdamW' for consistency.

Client 154 achieved a reasonable accuracy of 67.22% with a learning rate of 0.0005 and a batch size of 16. Given the client’s medium capacity, I will suggest using the same batch size to ensure their resources are not overwhelmed. The learning rate is conservative enough to avoid potential divergence while not being so low as to lead to underfitting. The weight decay is set to 0.0005, similar to the peer, helping with regularization but also keeping it manageable. I will keep the momentum at 0.9, consistent with peer practice, which is typically beneficial in training CNNs. The optimizer 'AdamW' is favored as it helps with weight decay directly, and 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler will help adjust the learning rate during training, potentially leading to better convergence. For local epochs, I'm suggesting 2, as it balances between overfitting and underfitting given it’s the first round. For dropout, setting it to 0.3 will help mitigate overfitting.

This is favorable as the guidance suggests higher learning rates for underfitting situations, and since we don't have a direct assessment of the model’s performance, this is a conservative approach. \n\nFor weight decay, a slightly higher value of 0.0006 is chosen to help with potential overfitting, considering that more regularization might be beneficial given the complexity of ResNet18 on CIFAR10. A momentum of 0.9 is consistent with what has been applied effectively by peers. \n\nI will use the AdamW optimizer because both peer users employed it with success. A local epoch count of 2 is appropriate given prior configurations, and a batch size of 64 is also consistent with good practices observed from peer clients and within the allowed values. Finally, I’ll set a dropout rate of 0.3, as seen in two peers that had promising results with this value, providing a balance against overfitting while allowing for learning flexibility.\n\nFor the server parameters, I’ll mirror the client with a learning rate of 0.0015 and maintain the momentum and optimizer as in the client setup, as this consistency tends to yield better collaborative results in federated learning. The scheduler will be set to 'None' for simplicity, allowing for straightforward learning dynamics. The mu value is set to 0.02, drawing from the operational practices of peers without deviating much, which maintains effective regularization without being overly aggressive.",

Therefore, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0005, staying within the range specified for client parameters, which may help in fine-tuning the model more effectively this time. The weight decay needs to be moderately adjusted as well; I will increase it to 0.0009 to help combat potential overfitting without going too high.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round and no previous results are available, it is prudent to start with conservative hyperparameters. For image classification tasks such as CIFAR-10, the choice of a lower learning rate can help in achieving stable convergence. Therefore, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is within the specified range and generally helps in better fine-tuning. Additionally, a weight_decay of 1e-04 will introduce some regularization to counter potential overfitting without being too aggressive. A momentum of 0.9 is chosen to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, particularly when the surface is steep. The 'Adam' optimizer is selected as it usually performs well for image classification tasks due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities. A batch_size of 32 is a reasonable choice for the client’s medium-capacity resources, ensuring that it can still compute updates efficiently. A local_epochs value of 2 will allow sufficient training without being overly intensive on client resources. A dropout_rate of 0.2 is moderate enough to prevent overfitting, given that the classification task may suffer from overfitting, especially with a complex architecture like ResNet18. On the server side, I will mirror the client learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 to maintain consistency, using the same 'Adam' optimizer while selecting 'StepLR' as the scheduler to adjust the learning rate over epochs, enhancing long-term learning stability. Lastly, setting mu to 0.01 provides a balance between local and global model contributions in the SplitFed system, promoting both learning accuracy and system stability.","hps": {

Given this was relatively satisfactory but could potentially be improved, I decided to decrease the learning_rate to 0.0005 (the highest value allowed closer to the previous setup) to ensure stability while optimizing performance. For weight_decay, from guidance on overfitting, I recommend increasing it slightly to 0.0005 to improve generalization without drastically affecting convergence. The momentum can remain at 0.9 as it was previously utilized successfully. I chose 'Adam' as the optimizer, well-suited for this task, to allow for adaptive learning rates. A scheduler is not applied here, as that may complicate consistency during training. The local_epochs of 2 are retained from the previous settings balanced against computational capacity, and a batch_size of 32 is also preserved for similar reasons. Lastly, I left the dropout_rate at 0.2 since it seems to aid in regularization without significantly compromising performance. For the server-side, I will adjust the learning_rate to 0.001 to maintain compatibility with client training while also providing effective convergence. Momentum remains at 0.9.

The momentum will remain at 0.9 and AdamW is retained as it performed adequately. The local epochs will be maintained at 2, balancing training time and effectiveness. For dropout, I will increase it to 0.2, providing additional regularization. The server’s learning rate remains at 0.001 to stabilize federated updates, which is optimally low.

I chose a learning rate of 0.0005, which is within the suggested range and reflects a cautious approach suitable for low-resource clients who may struggle with higher rates. The weight decay is set at 1e-04 to introduce regularization without being too aggressive considering their resource constraints. For momentum, I set it to 0.9, a commonly effective value that helps to stabilize updates. The optimizer is set to 'Adam', which tends to perform well across various tasks, along with 'CosineAnnealingLR' for gradual learning rate adjustments. The local epochs are limited to 2, allowing for enough training without overwhelming the client resources. I chose a batch size of 16, which is manageable given their limitations. Lastly, I set the dropout rate to 0.2 to help prevent overfitting while still being conducive for the lower-resource setup. For the server, I chose the same learning rate and momentum as the client to ensure consistency.

For `weight_decay`, I will utilize a small value of 1e-04 for regularization, as lower resource settings typically benefit from managing overfitting without being too harsh on the learning dynamics. I will choose the `Adam` optimizer due to its adaptive property; it's generally good for low-resource clients as it can handle sparse gradients effectively.

The `local_epochs` will be set to 3 to allow for sufficient training without overwhelming the client's capabilities, and the `batch_size` will be set to 16, which is manageable given the client's resource constraints. A `dropout_rate` of 0.2 is chosen to help prevent overfitting in the absence of prior metrics.

The last analysis noted that both training and test accuracies were consistent, indicating the choice of hyperparameters is heading in the right direction. However, since the learning rate is hitting the upper limit of its constraint (0.00025), I will lower it to 0.0001 to encourage more stable convergence, even though lower learning rates can help in improving final outcomes. Similarly, I will maintain the weight decay at 0.0005 for regularization as it is already helping. The momentum will stay at 0.9, a proven value. The optimizer choice is retained as 'AdamW' since it has shown good performance historically, and 'CosineAnnealingLR' will reduce the learning rate over epochs. The number of local epochs will be maintained at 2 to strike a balance between performance and computation, and the batch size will remain at 16 due to client capacity. Finally, to address potential overfitting and enhance generalization, I will increase the dropout rate from 0.3 to 0.4. On the server side, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0003, momentum at 0.9, and optimizer as 'AdamW' since no guidance suggests otherwise.

The peers achieved varying degrees of accuracy with learning rates between 0.0003 and 0.0005, so I will start with a value of 0.0003, which has been successful for clients 355 and 62. Since the client's capacity is medium, I will choose a moderate batch size of 16, which aligns with the peer history and balances resource usage. Weight decay should aid in regularization without overshooting; a value of 0.0005 has been effective for others, thus I'll set it to this value. For momentum, a typical choice of 0.9 aligns with peer choices and is effective in many scenarios. I will choose the 'AdamW' optimizer as it has demonstrated solid performance in peer cases; having used it successfully in this context. A dropout_rate of 0.3 was used by a peer with success, helping to mitigate overfitting without overly restricting the model's learning capacity. Local epochs will be set to 2, which is a common and balanced choice, ensuring sufficient training without overburdening resources. On the server side, for consistency, I will use the same learning rate of 0.0003 and momentum of 0.9, both of which have been effectively integrated with the AdamW optimizer for this task. A scheduler is listed as 'None' to keep the approach straightforward initially.

I will choose the `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler to help gradually decrease the learning rate, which can be effective in improving final performance. For `local_epochs`, I will use 2, which allows sufficient training without risking overfitting. A `batch_size` of 64 is appropriate for high-resource clients, allowing for effective gradient estimation. Lastly, I set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to mitigate overfitting while not being too aggressive at this initial stage. For the server, I will mirror the client's learning rate and optimizer settings to ensure consistency in learning during federated updates. I will also apply `CosineAnnealingLR` on the server for a cohesive learning strategy across clients. I choose `mu` as 0.05, which is a moderate value allowing for reasonable regularization during federated training and balancing local and global updates.",

Since the client's accuracy did not drop significantly, I suggest maintaining the learning rate at 0.005. However, I will slightly increase the weight decay to 0.0005 for better regularization without risking overfitting, as the data indicates a potential to improve generalization. The momentum is kept at 0.9, which is a standard choice, and I’ll maintain the optimizer as 'AdamW' due to its effectiveness. To improve training robustness, I’ll increase the dropout rate to 0.4, which can help mitigate overfitting, as the model deals with image data. The batch size of 64 is appropriate given the client’s high resource capability. The 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler is retained to allow the learning rate to adapt dynamically during training. For the server, I will copy the learning rate and momentum as these values are performing well; the optimizer 'AdamW' will provide stable updates, and I’ll keep the scheduler as 'CosineAnnealingLR' to match the client’s setup.

Since the training accuracy was not provided, we can't ascertain whether there's overfitting or underfitting directly. However, the client's current learning rate of 0.001 is at the upper limit of the recommended range for client parameters. Based on the guidance, if both accuracies are low, we would suggest a higher learning rate, but it seems to be achieving decent performance, so I will maintain the learning rate. Given that the client has the capacity of Cluster 2, we can afford a higher batch size, which I will set to 128—in line with the specified constraints. The weight decay will be increased to help with any potential overfitting, setting it to 0.0005. The dropout rate will be increased to 0.3 to provide more regularization based on the guidance suggesting adjustments in the case of low test accuracy. The momentum will remain within the established range at 0.9, and the optimizer will stay as 'AdamW' for continuity and effectiveness. The server parameters will align with the client's, retaining the same learning rate, optimizer, and momentum, with a scheduler set to 'None' to keep the configuration simple as higher adaptivity wouldn't be warranted without sufficient data on previous rounds.

Since the task is image classification with ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, I will suggest the following hyperparameters:\n\n1. **Learning Rate**: I will set it to 0.001. This value is optimal for training in image classification tasks and is a generally safe starting point.\n2. **Weight Decay**: A weight decay of 1e-05 will be used to help with generalization, although I could choose a higher value up to 0.001, I will start conservatively due to the client's moderate resources.\n3. **Momentum**: A momentum value of 0.9 is common in CNN training and should help improve convergence speed without being excessively aggressive.\n4. **Optimizer**: I will choose 'AdamW' as it is relatively robust and effective in handling varying data distributions, especially for deep learning tasks like image classification.\n5. **Scheduler**: I will select 'CosineAnnealingLR' to allow the learning rate to adapt during training, which can support better convergence.\n6. **Local Epochs**: For local training, I will set it to 2, as this is a balanced amount that allows the client to efficiently utilize resources without overfitting prematurely.\n7. **Batch Size**: I will pick 32 as it strikes a good balance between resource usage and the ability to generalize well from the data.\n8. **Dropout Rate**: A dropout rate of 0.2 is reasonable to prevent overfitting while maintaining model performance.\n\nFor the server-side hyperparameters, I will align closely with the client while potentially opting for a slightly different optimizer that encourages stability across federated learning rounds.

The previous hyperparameters showed a relatively high learning rate of 0.001, which is on the upper end of the range for low-resource clients. Hence, I will decrease the learning rate to 0.0005 to allow for more stable learning. In addition, the client is operating in a low-resource environment. Therefore, I will also use a smaller batch size of 8 to ensure the training is stable and feasible. The weight decay will be set to a middle ground of 0.0005 to help prevent overfitting without being too restrictive. I will retain the momentum at 0.9 as it is commonly effective and falls within the allowable range. The optimizer will be changed to 'AdamW' as it often performs better for image tasks compared to 'Adam'. The local_epochs will be set to 2 to provide adequate training without overwhelming resource constraints. I'll maintain a dropout rate of 0.2 as it has previously shown to prevent overfitting effectively without excessive loss of information. \n\nFor the server parameters, I will keep the learning rate at 0.001 to ensure it is performing adequately across clients, which is a reasonable middle ground for federated learning. The optimizer will remain 'Adam', consistent with prior successful configurations. I will use 'None' for the scheduler at this stage since adding a complexity back into the server could be premature without evidence of performance gains. The momentum will also be set at 0.9 as a standard that typically works well.

Since there are no signs of overfitting (as both accuracies were not provided), but the resources are limited, reducing the learning rate to a more conservative 0.0005 is beneficial. This balances stability while allowing exploration of model space. For the weight decay, I will increase it slightly to 0.0005 to help with regularization. The client's past momentum of 0.9 is effective, so I will retain that. For the optimizer, I will continue with AdamW, as it is widely regarded for its efficiency in training deep networks. I propose using a batch size of 16 to fit with the client's resource constraints and limit local epochs to 2. A dropout rate of 0.3 is selected to further prevent potential overfitting by introducing further regularization. On the server side, I will select a learning rate of 0.001, consistent with the client's history for stability, alongside the same momentum and optimizer as the client.

However, considering that the last two tests had similar accuracies but did not improve, it's necessary to shift the learning rate down towards the lower boundary, which helps prevent potential overfitting. Based on previous trials, a learning rate of 0.0002 is a prudent choice, allowing for stable convergence while avoiding high overfitting. Furthermore, increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0008 can help with regularization as the values were previously set at 0.0007, and no improvement was observed. The `momentum` remains stable at 0.9 as it is effective for optimizing the learning process. Additionally, maintaining `local_epochs` to 2 aligns with previous successful configurations without over-complicating updates. Using `batch_size` of 32 is optimal based on client cluster resources. For `dropout_rate`, increasing it to 0.4 will address potential overfitting due to the recent trend toward higher train accuracy compared to test accuracy.\n\nOn the server side, I recommend maintaining the current server parameters, keeping learning rate at 0.0005 (within the effective range for server learning rates), momentum at 0.9, and the optimizer as AdamW since it has been stable in past configurations.

The current learning rate of 0.001 is reasonable but can be optimized slightly for better results, considering the potential to achieve both faster convergence without overfitting. Thus, I suggest using the upper bound of the learning rate (0.005) to encourage better exploration of the loss landscape. Additionally, observing no fluctuation in accuracy implies possible signs of underfitting; hence, we will increase the dropout rate, which was initially set at 0.2, to 0.25 to bolster the model's robustness against overfitting while retaining generalization capacity. The weight decay will be kept at 0.0005 as it has yet to show significant influence on the outcome, but I will increase momentum slightly to 0.95 for better optimization performance.

Given that the client has high-resource capabilities, lowering the learning rate to 0.00025 can provide more stable updates while giving room for slight adjustments. Keeping the weight_decay the same (0.0005) is reasonable since it helped maintain regularization effectively, while the momentum stays at 0.9 as it has shown reliability in past runs. The optimizer remains 'AdamW' as it is commonly effective with ResNet architectures. I will maintain local_epochs at 2, which strikes a good balance between convergence speed and stability.

Given the CIFAR-10 is a relatively challenging dataset for image classification tasks, choosing a `learning_rate` of 0.001 balances between underfitting and potential learning issues. For `weight_decay`, I will use 0.0001 to provide some regularization against overfitting, which is especially important given the complexity of ResNet18. As per guidance, momentum will be set to 0.9 to stabilize the convergence. The optimizer of choice will be `AdamW` for its adaptive capabilities, which is beneficial for diverse datasets. For the training process, a `batch_size` of 64 is a reasonable middle ground for the moderate resource client, combined with 2 `local_epochs`, which should be sufficient for initial adjustments without overwhelming the resources. Lastly, I will set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to help regularize and mitigate any potential overfitting during the training. On the server side, I will maintain the same `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and `optimizer` as the client to facilitate consistency across training and aggregation. The `scheduler` will be set to `None` as there is insufficient data to support the need for a learning rate adjustment schedule in this initial round.

To reduce overfitting, I will increase the `weight_decay` to 0.0005, which is the maximum allowed value. This should help regularize the model further.

The momentum value of 0.9 is chosen as it is commonly effective for SGD optimizers, which provides a good balance between convergence speed and stability.

This suggests the model is close to an optimal configuration, given that the accuracy is reasonably high. However, to further refine and ensure stability while potentially improving generalization, I will lower the learning rate to 0.0001. This aligns with the guidance suggesting that if training accuracy is high but test accuracy is not improving, lowering the learning rate is beneficial for convergence. The weight decay has previously been set at 0.0006, which is adequate to prevent overfitting. There is also a slight drop in accuracy from peer client 268, who used a dropout rate of 0.4, indicating a possible area for adjustment. I will increase the dropout rate to 0.4 to mitigate overfitting further. Keeping the local epochs at 2 and maintaining the batch size of 64 from prior configurations seems suitable given client capacity.

To stay within constraints and align with the findings, I am setting 'weight_decay' to 0.0001, a low value to prevent excessive regularization, since we are still uncertain about overfitting or underfitting in the absence of previous rounds’ data. The optimizer will be 'Adam' due to its stability and effectiveness in image classification tasks, while the momentum will be set at 0.9 to help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions. The local epochs should be 2 to enable a balance between learning and efficiency. Lastly, the mu value remains conservative at 0.05, aligning with the first round's cautious approach.",

    "reasoning": "The client's history shows a decline in test accuracy from 57.85% to 52.95% with the use of different hyperparameters, indicating potential issues with either overfitting or less effective parameter choices. Since the test accuracy dropped despite a lower learning rate (0.0005) and increasing weight decay (0.0005), this suggests that the chosen learning rate might still be too high for the low-resource client, or that the optimizer choice (AdamW) did not perform well. In observing the higher-performing peer (Client 124 at 75.13% accuracy) who used a lower learning rate (0.0003) with Adam, I will adopt a more conservative learning rate strategy. The batch sizes should remain small due to the client's low-resource nature; thus, I will use 8. A dropout rate of 0.4 is warranted based on the peer's success, and I will favor a weight decay of 0.0001 rather than 0.0005 for stability. For the server, a consistent learning rate of 0.001 is maintained alongside the Adam optimizer, as these settings appear to be more stable based on peer analysis.

To enhance stability for low-resource clients, I will opt for a learning_rate of 0.0003, which is toward the upper limit but remains in the acceptable range. This is because underfitting may be present, as both previous accuracies were low indicating we need slightly more aggressive learning parameters to encourage better convergence. The weight_decay will be set to 1e-05, which is consistent with their latest attempt and helps mitigate overfitting. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which is common and effective across samples. The optimizer will be AdamW due to its adaptability, having been used in the last successful runs. Following the guidance to manage the low-resource nature of the client, I retain batch_size at 16, which keeps stability without overloading resources. The dropout_rate will also stay at 0.3, as this already helps avoid overfitting while still allowing good learning potential. For the server side, I will maintain the learning_rate at 0.001 and utilize the same optimizer type, 'AdamW'. This is consistent with successful configurations from peers.

This can help in regularization effectively without restricting model learning.\n3. **Momentum**: A momentum of 0.9 is commonly accepted and can effectively accelerate gradients during training, reducing oscillations.\n4. **Optimizer**: I will choose 'Adam', as it performs well across various tasks and adapts the learning rate, which can aid in training with CIFAR-10 images.\n5. **Scheduler**: No learning rate scheduling at this point (set to 'None') since it is the first round, helping maintain initial learning dynamics.\n6. **Local Epochs**: A value of 2 strikes a balance between learning and resource constraints for a medium-capacity cluster. \n7. **Batch Size**: I will select 32, which aligns with moderate capacity, providing a reasonable compromise between training speed and resource use.\n8. **Dropout Rate**: A dropout of 0.2 is reasonable, starting to mitigate any potential overfitting without excessively hindering learning capacity.\n\nFor server-side hyperparameters, I will mirror some choices to maintain consistency; thus I am choosing a learning_rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for stability. The optimizer will also be 'Adam'. Choosing 'None' for the scheduler allows the server optimization process to focus on the current learning dynamics without additional complexity.

For the client-side parameters, I have chosen a lower learning rate of 0.001 to prevent any potential instability while trying to train the model on a weak client. The weight decay is set to 1e-05 to introduce minimal regularization while keeping the resource limit in mind. The momentum is specified as 0.9, a common default that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. I chose the 'Adam' optimizer because it tends to work well across various tasks and does not require excessive computational power compared to SGD. For the scheduler, I opted for 'None', as no previous epochs are available to base decay adjustments on. The local epochs are set to 2, allowing for a moderate number of updates during local training while balancing the number of communication rounds. The batch size is set to 16, which is on the lower end suitable for low-resource clients. Finally, I've set the dropout rate to 0.2 to help mitigate overfitting. For the server-side parameters, I have maintained a consistent learning rate of 0.001 with Adam optimizer, as it functions similarly to the client's optimizer and allows for fine-tuning under the federated setup. The same momentum of 0.9 is used for consistency across client and server. Lastly, I chose 'None' for the server scheduler to keep things simple during initial rounds.

The peer client used the same rate and achieved satisfactory accuracy, indicating it's a safe choice for initial experimentation.

Momentum is kept at 0.9, a conventional choice in SGD, ensuring stable convergence. The choice of AdamW as the optimizer is made because it generally performs better in computer vision tasks and is more robust for training deep networks like ResNet. The local epochs are set to 2, providing a good trade-off between training time and model refinement. A batch size of 128 is ideal for high-resource clients and allows ample diversity in mini-batches.

    "reasoning": "Based on the client's previous performance with a test accuracy of 81.63%, modifications are needed to optimize further. The learning rate is currently at 0.001, which is at the higher end of the acceptable range and can be adjusted downwards to improve generalization (lower test accuracy would suggest potential overfitting). I propose decreasing the learning rate to 0.0005, which is still aggressive for a high-resource client but allows for a more stable convergence. In line with this, the weight decay must be increased to 0.0005 to help with regularization and combat overfitting, adhering to guidance that suggests a higher weight decay when facing overfitting symptoms. Retaining a momentum of 0.9 is beneficial for smoothing out updates during training, and 'AdamW' remains a strong choice due to its adaptive nature. I opted for a batch size of 128, as it has previously been successful. Keeping local_epochs at 2 provides a balance between computational efficiency and model training depth while avoiding issues with overfitting. Lastly, I suggest keeping the dropout_rate at 0.3, as it has previously yielded good results without being too aggressive. For the server side, maintaining a learning rate of 0.001 is appropriate as it has been effective in the past. A momentum of 0.9 is consistent with best practices and ensuring a smooth gradient descent process.

Since both the client and peer used the same parameters with differing results, it is likely beneficial to explore slightly more aggressive settings. Hence, I'm increasing the learning rate to 0.0007, which is close to the upper bound but still adheres to the recommendation for clients with high capacity. The weight decay is increased to 0.0007 to help mitigate overfitting, especially since the training accuracy might be excessively high compared to the test accuracy. The dropout rate is kept at 0.3, which has been previously effective. The batch size is maximized to 256 to leverage the client’s capacity, and local epochs are kept at 2 to maintain a stable training routine. For the server, I've similarly decided to increase the learning rate to 0.001, which is the maximum allowed, to enhance the server's ability to adapt quickly to updates. The server's momentum is set to 0.9, maintaining consistency with the client setting.

    "reasoning": "The task is an image classification problem using ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Given the client's first iteration, there is no prior training history to reference. However, a peer (Client 163) achieved 81.26% accuracy with specified hyperparameters that looked conservative, which provides a baseline. I will argue for values that reflect moderate resource capacity while also aiming for stability in training. For the client side, the learning rate is set to 0.001 to balance training speed and stability — it is within the recommended range where slight adjustments can affect generalization. The weight decay of 0.0005 is effective for regularization, helping mitigate potential overfitting. A momentum of 0.9 provides sufficient momentum in optimization, based on peer practices. I propose using the SGD optimizer, as it is typically robust for image classification tasks. Keeping the local_epochs at 2 ensures that the model receives adequate updates without overwhelming the learning process. The batch size is set to 32, falling within the recommended range for medium-resource clients, allowing efficient computation with reasonable memory use. A dropout rate of 0.3 has been chosen, as it aids in regularization without excessively hindering learning. For the server side, I am mirroring the learning rate and momentum with the same reasoning to maintain consistency while allowing the server to adequately handle federated updates. The optimizer remains SGD, which aligns with the client choice. I suggest a mu value of 0.01, a reasonable start for FedProx regularization, ensuring effective convergence without being overly aggressive. Overall, the chosen hyperparameters are tailored for balance between learning efficiency and stability.",

The weight decay can be set to 0.0005, which is consistent with the peer's performance and helps prevent overfitting. A momentum of 0.9 has shown success in the past as well, so it will be kept constant. The optimizer 'SGD' is functional and widely used; hence no change is needed. A local epoch count of 2 is optimum given the medium resource constraints, balancing convergence speed and computational load.

A weight decay of 0.0005 is suitable to moderate overfitting without being too aggressive. Keeping the momentum at 0.9 aligns with previous successful attempts and is within constraints.

Given that the test accuracy is relatively high, it's probable that we are close to an optimal point. However, since peers and recent runs showed that increasing the weight decay (to 0.0009 in peer 121's case) led to improved accuracy, I suggest increasing the weight_decay to 0.0009 to prevent overfitting while maintaining a learning_rate of 0.0005. The batch_size should maximize the use of available resources, so I will suggest the largest option of 512. The dropout_rate will be increased to 0.4 as suggested by peer observation which has shown improvements in accuracy with a higher dropout, thus hopefully preventing overfitting. The server's parameters remain stable as the current learning_rate and momentum are effective. Setting mu to 0.01 will maintain the regularization effects of FedProx.",

    "reasoning": "The client's history shows a pattern where higher learning rates (0.005) improved accuracy but may have also contributed to instability. Given that the last successful hyperparameter set had a learning rate of 0.0005, it suggests that a smaller learning rate is optimal. This aligns with the guidance that argues for increasing the weight decay in cases of overfitting, though the test accuracies indicate no immediate concern for overfitting as slightly differing captures still yielded good results. The latest test accuracy of 78.49% was achieved at a learning rate of 0.0005 and weight decay of 0.0009, indicating the potential for slightly adjusting the weight decay upwards to 0.001 in order to improve generalization without risking overfitting drastically. To implement a slight restructuring while considering potential benefits, I opt to increase the dropout rate minimally to 0.5, which will help regularize the model further. The local epochs can remain at 2 as this value didn't adversely affect the results before. For the server settings, I maintain a learning rate of 0.001, as it has been stable in prior iterations, retaining a momentum value of 0.9. I will keep the optimization strategy consistent with 'AdamW' for stability across communications, and the scheduler remains 'None' as per historical configurations. The value for mu will be set conservatively at 0.01, consistent with prior configurations. Overall, these adjustments should help refine performance while adhering to the constraints provided.",

The momentum of 0.9 appears consistent across trials and has not shown any significant negative impact, so it will remain unchanged. The optimizer will continue to be 'AdamW' as it has been effective for this model on CIFAR-10. For the batch_size, I will maintain 16, which has been stable for the client’s low-resource capacity. Additionally, I will keep the dropout_rate at 0.4, since consistency has been shown with dropout in previous tests. For the server parameters, I will utilize the learning_rate at 0.0005, retaining the current best practice as it has been historically applied during effective trials by the client. Finally, I will maintain mu at 0.01, as it aligns with the federated approach and has been successfully implemented previously. Overall, these adjustments aim to enhance training stability while adhering to the given constraints.",

Peer 397 also utilized a weight decay of 0.0001, which is reasonable for regularization without introducing significant bias. The momentum of 0.9 aligns with the guidance to help in convergence. The optimizer will be 'AdamW', which is efficient for training neural networks including ResNet architectures. A dropout rate of 0.4, as used by the peer, strikes a good balance for generalization while avoiding overfitting. The number of local epochs will be set to 2, as this provides a balance between training time and performance improvements. For the server parameters, a matching learning rate of 0.0003 and momentum of 0.9 will be maintained, using the same 'AdamW' optimizer. As there are no specific server scheduling requirements from the peer, I will use 'None' for the scheduler. A 'mu' value of 0.02 will be selected, as it was used successfully by peer 397, providing a regularization mechanism without being overly restrictive.",

I will maintain the use of the 'Adam' optimizer as it is effective and was previously used with some success.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the client's first round, we need to set conservative hyperparameters that align with their low-resource capabilities. The previous peer's success with a learning rate of 0.0005 indicates that lower learning rates may be effective for stable training, especially for clients in similar capacities. Therefore, I will suggest a learning rate of 0.0005 for the client. Peer 381 also utilized a weight decay of 1e-05, which seems to balance the regularization without risking gradient issues, so I will replicate that value. A momentum of 0.9 is a common stable choice in various contexts, and since the batch size could be either 8 or 16 due to low resources, I will opt for 16 for a better gradient approximation. Furthermore, I will choose 'Adam' as the optimizer since it provides adaptive learning rates which are beneficial in low-resource environments. The choice of a dropout rate of 0.3 appears effective in managing overfitting based on peer performance, and local epochs will be set to 2 to allow ample updates without excessive computation time. On the server side, I will align the parameters with those of the client's peer to ensure consistency and utilize a learning rate of 0.001 which is standard for federated settings, maintaining a momentum of 0.9 and 'Adam' optimizer with 'None' for the scheduler to simplify the training progression. Finally, I will set `mu` to 0.01 to allow for effective FedProx regularization. Overall, these choices maintain adherence to the constraints while catering to low-resource conditions, optimizing for stability and performance.",

Given this, the choice of `learning_rate` has to be low due to the constraints, so I will set it towards the upper end, which is 0.0002, to ensure we still have sufficient learning capacity while adhering to the constraints. The `weight_decay` will be set to 0.0006, which is based on client 498's recent successful test run, as it shows a promising trend without risking heavy overfitting. The `momentum` is set to 0.9, which is often stable enough for this kind of model. We will continue using the 'AdamW' optimizer, as it has shown better performance in the past configurations. The `scheduler` will remain as 'StepLR', following a common practice in managing learning rates during training. The `local_epochs` will stay at 2, as this was already established, while the `batch_size` will drop to 16 from 24 to better align with the medium-resource cluster capacity. Finally, I will set the `dropout_rate` to 0.3 to prevent overfitting while taking into account the midrange metrics of previous testing.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client and there is no prior history of performance, I will take a conservative approach with the hyperparameters. The model is expected to handle a range of values given its category (ResNet18 for CIFAR10). A moderate learning rate of 0.001 is chosen to start, to prevent any rapid divergence during training while still being aggressive enough to learn effectively. The weight decay is set to 0.0001 to provide a light regularization effect, as we don't know if the client will face overfitting issues yet. A momentum of 0.9 is a commonly used value and can help accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, which should be effective given the computational capacity of Cluster 2. For the optimizer, AdamW is selected due to its popularity in similar image classification tasks, known for adapting the learning rates and potentially yielding better results. I've set the scheduler to None as we are starting fresh and it's better to see the initial trends first. I opted for a local_epoch setting of 2, allowing enough training time per federated round to gather decent updates. A batch size of 64 optimally balances effective gradient updates with computational efficiency. Lastly, I've introduced a dropout rate of 0.2 to mitigate potential overfitting, common in image classification tasks, especially early in training. On the server side, I retained the same learning rate and momentum of 0.001 and 0.9 respectively for consistency in optimization direction, with the same optimizer (AdamW) and no scheduling. The mu value is set at 0.01, balancing the FedProx regularization with effective learning during federated updates.",

To address this, the learning rate will be adjusted down to 0.0004, remaining within the allowed range but trying to find a more optimal setting.

Considering the client capacity of low resources, I will keep the `batch_size` at 16 and `local_epochs` at 2 to ensure training stability.

The weight decay has recently been effective at 0.0002; however, given that the handling of the training and test accuracy discrepancies has been limited, increasing the weight decay slightly to 0.0003 may aid in further regularizing the model, particularly since larger batch sizes have been employed (512).

The optimizer remains 'AdamW', which has shown favorable results in prior configurations. The dropout rate has previously been effective at 0.3, thus I suggest retaining it to maintain model generalization.

The weight_decay is set to 1e-04 for regularization, low enough to avoid excessive penalization while guarding against overfitting. The momentum is kept at 0.9, providing a good trade-off between convergence speed and stability. The choice of optimizer is AdamW, suitable for this model type, and I've chosen 'StepLR' for the scheduler to allow gradual adjustments in learning rate. Local_epochs is set to 2 to give the model sufficient training time within the constraints of client resources. A batch size of 16 is selected as a middle ground that respects the low-resource environment while still being reasonable for image classification tasks. Finally, a dropout_rate of 0.2 is chosen to help mitigate overfitting by randomly ignoring a fraction of neurons during training.

The test accuracy is improving, which points to fine-tuning rather than drastic hyperparameter changes. Since the previous configurations were close to ideal, I will lower the `learning_rate` slightly to 0.0003, close to the upper constraint while still allowing for some learning capacity. The weight decay will be increased to `0.0005`, as it provides additional regularization to further reduce overfitting risk seen in the accuracies. The `momentum` remains `0.9`, which has been effective, and the optimizer stays as `AdamW`. The `local_epochs` will remain `2`, and I will also increase `batch_size` to `32` to fully utilize client resources. As for `dropout_rate`, I will keep it at `0.2`, aiming to maintain a level of preventing overfitting. For server parameters, keeping the `learning_rate` at `0.001` seems appropriate to facilitate learning while being balanced with the client's adjustments.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the first round for the client, I will base my hyperparameter choices on the peer history. The peer with the highest accuracy (Client 204) had a learning rate of 0.0005, which is conservative and effective. Client 330 and 346 used rates of 0.0006, which also yielded respectable results. As the client is in a high-resource category, a learning rate of 0.0006 seems adequate to balance convergence speed with stability. For weight decay, both Client 330 and 346 used values in a similar range (0.0005 to 0.0007), which indicates the importance of regularization. I will choose a weight decay of 0.0005 to help with regularization without excessively slowing down training. The momentum of 0.9 is consistent across peers and is a proven choice, so I will use that. The optimizer 'AdamW' was used successfully by all peers, so I will stick with it. The local epochs will be set to 2, allowing for ample training while avoiding possible overfitting. A batch size of 128, used successfully by Client 346, is optimal for high-resource clients. Lastly, I will set the dropout rate to 0.4, consistent with Client 330's approach to help mitigate overfitting while still allowing for a good generalization capability. For the server, I will mirror the learning rate and momentum from peer histories to maintain coherence, specifically using 0.001 for the server learning rate and maintaining momentum at 0.9.

The `momentum` remains stable at 0.9 as it has shown consistency across the previous models. The `optimizer` will remain `AdamW`, as it has worked correctly previously.

For the client parameters, I chose a `learning_rate` of 0.001, as this is a good starting point for most training regimes and balances between convergence speed and stability. I selected `weight_decay` of 0.0001, which is low enough to avoid underfitting yet provides light regularization to combat overfitting if necessary. The `momentum` is set to 0.9, a common choice that helps accelerate SGD in relevant directions while dampening oscillations. I opted for `AdamW` as the optimizer because it performs well with high-dimensional data like images, and I chose `CosineAnnealingLR` as the scheduler to allow for learning rate adjustments that can help in finding a good local minimum. A `local_epochs` of 2 balances between too few and overfitting the local data, while `batch_size` is set at 64 to utilize the high resource capacity effectively without overwhelming memory constraints. The `dropout_rate` is set at 0.3, which is moderate enough to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to learn effectively.\n  \nFor the server parameters, I set a `learning_rate` also to 0.001 to maintain consistent training dynamics. The `momentum` remains 0.9 here for continuity and effectiveness. I retained `AdamW` as the optimizer for similar reasons to the client. I set the `scheduler` to 'None' since this can keep server-side updates simpler and is appropriate if local epochs are already effectively managing the learning rate.

Given the client's history, there's been a notable improvement in test accuracy when the learning rate was lowered to 0.0005 (57.88% test accuracy in Epoch 38). This indicates a potential issue with a higher learning rate, suggesting we keep it conservative. The weight decay was kept constant at 0.0001, but to prevent overfitting—wheretraining accuracy improves at the expense of test accuracy—a slight increase is warranted to a higher weight decay while remaining within constraints. The current batch size of 16 is likely adequate, but since the client is on a low-resource setup, it might be beneficial to switch to a lower batch size of 8 to enhance training stability, though we will keep it at 16 since they are accustomed to higher values as observed in Session 38. Dropout increased to 0.3 in the last session; however, maintaining it at 0.3 is justified as it is preventing overfitting effectively. For the server-side, I will maintain the same optimizer, learning rate, and momentum since they worked effectively in past sessions.

A momentum value of 0.9 is standard for optimizers like AdamW and provides good convergence characteristics, aligning with Client 111's settings. The optimizer will be set to AdamW, as its adaptive learning rates can be beneficial for image classification tasks. Given the medium-resource capacity of the client, a local epoch of 2 and a batch size of 32 strikes a balance between computed efficiency and convergence speed. Moreover, to ensure we mitigate potential overfitting, I will set the dropout rate to 0.4, similar to Client 111.

However, considering the powerful resources available for a high-capacity client, we can afford to utilize larger batch sizes and more aggressive learning rates. For the `learning_rate`, setting it to 0.01 is optimal, as aggressive learning can help speed up convergence when starting from scratch. For `weight_decay`, I will set it to 0.0005, a moderate value to prevent potential overfitting, given that we are dealing with a relatively complex model on a more straightforward dataset. Choosing `momentum` at 0.9 aligns with common practices in training CNNs, aiding in faster convergence. The optimizer `Adam` is selected due to its effectiveness in dealing with non-stationary objectives, which can be particularly beneficial for CNNs as it adjusts the learning rate dynamically. A `scheduler` of `None` is chosen at this point because we want to maintain consistency in the aggressive learning rate as it's the first training round. I will set `local_epochs` to 3 to allow the model to learn adequately from the local data before aggregating model updates, and `batch_size` is chosen to be 128 to utilize the high resources optimally. Lastly, a `dropout_rate` of 0.3 is set to help manage overfitting while maintaining sufficient capacity to learn complex patterns. For the server parameters, we keep the `learning_rate` at 0.001 and `momentum` at 0.9, consistent with client parameters, using `Adam` for its robustness in federated learning settings.

Since their test accuracy (77.86%) is reasonably high but was not maximized, a more conservative learning_rate of 0.005 is selected to ensure better convergence without overshooting minima. Increasing the weight_decay to 0.0008 will help mitigate overfitting by adding regularization. The momentum is maintained at 0.9 based on its successful previous usage. I am opting for the 'Adam' optimizer, as it generally performs well for image classification and suits high-resource clients.

A batch_size of 128 and a dropout_rate of 0.3 are consistent with the client's capacity and their previous settings.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client and there is no prior history to drive the hyperparameter selections, I will opt for a balanced approach that aligns with typical best practices for handling image classification tasks using ResNet18 on CIFAR-10. The choice of learning rate is critical; I will set it to 0.001, a common starting point that is not too aggressive, which should prevent immediate divergence while still enabling learning. The weight_decay is set to 0.0001 for mild regularization, helping to counter potential overfitting without being too restrictive. Momentum is set to 0.9, which is generally favorable for achieving stable convergence in SGD and creating smoother gradient updates. The optimizer will be set to 'AdamW', which is well-regarded for its effectiveness on image classification tasks given its capability of weighting parameters adaptively and its handling of regularization well. A scheduler of 'CosineAnnealingLR' is chosen to adjust the learning rate dynamically through training, promoting better convergence over epochs. Given the client capacity is medium-resource, I suggest 2 local_epochs, balancing learning without overwhelming the computational limits of the client. A batch_size of 32 strikes a good balance for this capacity, allowing for sufficient update frequency while retaining some level of stochasticity. Regarding dropout_rate, I suggest a value of 0.3 to mitigate overfitting in the early training phases without overly constraining the network’s capacity to learn effectively. For the server, I will maintain the same learning rate and optimizer strategy, setting the momentum to 0.9 again to ensure consistency with the client. The scheduler remains 'None', as server-side optimization often benefits from not modifying the learning rate during communication periods. For mu, I suggest 0.01, which is a moderate value that supports regularization of the federated learning model without diminishing the learning dynamics in this first round.",

    "reasoning": "In this client's previous trial, the test accuracy of 77.68% indicates room for improvement, especially given the current hyperparameters. Since the client used a learning rate of 0.001, which is mid-range, and achieved a healthy test accuracy, I will opt for the lower end of the spectrum to promote better convergence and potentially avoid overfitting. Hence, I reduced the learning rate slightly to 0.0005. The weight decay was at 0.0001; given that it can help mitigate overfitting, I will maintain it at this level because it's already providing some regularization. The momentum is set at 0.9, which is reasonable and has worked in the past, so I will keep it the same. The optimizer remains "AdamW" as it’s one of the best choices for image classification tasks. The scheduler will still be "CosineAnnealingLR" to help with learning rate adjustments throughout epochs. Local epochs are kept at 2, which is a balanced choice. The batch size stays at 32, as it’s typical for medium-resource clients, and plays a critical role in stabilizing training. Finally, the dropout rate of 0.3 was previously used and maintained, as it's effective in preventing overfitting without being too aggressive. For the server parameters, I retained the previous learning rate of 0.001. This consistency is beneficial for federated setups. The momentum and optimizer settings are also retained to maintain coherence across model training.

Starting with a learning rate of 0.0001, as indicated by Client 111, is prudent to avoid potential instability in training and aligns with the guideline of adjusting the learning rate based on both underfitting and overfitting concerns. Since there’s no prior indication of overfitting or underfitting from the client’s own history, we can tentatively maintain their dropout rate. For regularization, I will select a weight decay of 0.0004, consistent with peer Client 111, which also aids in preventing overfitting. The momentum of 0.9 follows the common practice seen in peer training. Since Client 111 used 'AdamW' as the optimizer, we will adopt the same, which typically provides better convergence for image classification tasks.

However, the gradual decrease in accuracy between Epoch 38 and Epoch 39 suggests a potential plateau. To combat this, I will set the learning rate to a slightly higher level within the constraints to encourage more learning (0.0002). The weight decay was increasing over the epochs, which helped prevent overfitting, thus I will keep it at 0.0004, which has been consistent without negatively affecting performance. For the batch size, previously successful values were 20 and 24, thus I will choose 32, which offers a good balance under medium-resource constraints.

Thus, I will lower the `learning_rate` to 0.0003, which is the upper limit within the acceptable range, to allow the model to train a bit more conservatively and carefully. A `weight_decay` of 0.0002 is chosen to introduce some regularization without being too aggressive, as the peer history indicated that consistent values were yielding varying performance. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which is a good standard choice. The optimizer will be kept as 'SGD' since it's been successful. For the `scheduler`, I will opt for 'None' to keep the simplicity at this stage. The `local_epochs` should remain at 2, given that this was the previous successful configuration, and the `batch_size` will revert to 16 to maximize training data per update step while being reasonable for the resource constraints. A `dropout_rate` of 0.3 will remain unchanged as it helps in reducing overfitting without losing significant information. The server parameters also leverage the same previous learning rate of 0.001, supporting the client with consistent feedback for continued training. Keeping the server's `momentum` at 0.9 and the optimizer as 'SGD' aligns with past configurations, and the `scheduler` remains 'None' for simplicity.

    "reasoning": "The client's last test accuracy was 79.46%, which indicates the model is performing adequately but may have room for improvement. Given that this accuracy is on the higher end, indicating a potential for overfitting, I suggest a slightly reduced learning rate and a higher weight decay to provide better regularization. The previous learning rates were around 0.0005, but to align with the hyperparameter constraints, I will select a learning rate of 0.0003, which is still high enough to allow effective learning without overly risking divergence. The weight decay will be increased slightly to 0.0005 to further counter any potential overfitting by encouraging smaller weight magnitudes. 

    The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.2, as it helps prevent overfitting without drastically limiting the learning capacity. Given the client capacity as 'Medium-Resource', a batch size of 32 is appropriate for effective updates without overwhelming resource capabilities. For the momentum, I will set it to 0.9, aligning with the past values and known practices in training deep networks for stability in updates.

    The server parameters will closely follow the client's, using the same learning rate (0.0003) for coherence between local and server learning. I will utilize the 'Adam' optimizer, which has shown effectiveness in similar setups, and a 'None' scheduler since there is no observed improvement need for more complex scheduling given the last configurations. The mu value will be set to 0.01 as it was previously employed without any issues, balancing regularization across federated learning efforts.",

Given a history of training with a learning rate of 0.0005 and a weight decay of 0.0002, both parameters may have contributed positively. Since the test accuracy is quite static, we'll further optimize the learning rate down to 0.0005 to facilitate better convergence. The weight decay should be increased to 0.0003 to combat potential overfitting, as the client has low-resource capabilities and binning too much data could lead to inefficiencies.

The client has a medium capacity and can afford a slightly higher batch size while still being cautious to avoid underfitting or overfitting. Since we want to strike a balance, I will go with a learning rate of 0.0001, which is at the lower boundary to prevent potential overfitting, and a weight decay of 0.0006 to aid regularization. A momentum of 0.9 is standard in literature and has also been effective for peer clients. For the optimizer, I will choose 'Adam' as it is generally robust for image classification tasks. A local epoch value of 2 will provide a reasonable number of iterations without overwhelming the model capacity. I will also select a batch size of 32, which provides sufficient data per iteration without being too resource-intensive. A dropout rate of 0.3 appears to be in line with what worked for client 498, helping reduce overfitting without excessively hindering learning.

The batch size is influenced by resource constraints, and I will use 32, which balances the ability to make meaningful updates with the available compute. A dropout rate of 0.3 is suitable for this model, serving as a regularization technique to further help reduce overfitting. For the server parameters, I will mirror the client learning rate of 0.0002, with the same momentum and optimizer to ensure consistency.

    "reasoning": "Considering the task involves image classification using ResNet18 on the cifar10 dataset, my hyperparameter choices mainly focus on addressing overfitting and maximizing the model's performance based on the client's history. The client has previously used a learning rate of 0.0002 with a test accuracy of 80.39%, suggesting this value is appropriate. However, given the low performance of peer 498 with a similar learning rate (0.0001) but slightly different settings, I will choose 0.0001, which is the upper limit to provide a slightly more stable training process. For weight decay, I recommend increasing it to 0.0008 to combat any potential overfitting, as regularization is essential at this stage. The client's momentum of 0.9 is consistent with best practices, while the Adam optimizer has proven effective in prior trials, and I retain the dropout rate at 0.3 since it strikes a balance between improving generalization and maintaining model complexity. I set the batch size to 32 for practical local training (a middle-ground choice for medium-resource clients) and maintain local epochs at 2, aligning with the previous successful settings. On the server side, I will apply the same learning rate chosen for the client to maintain consistency and support coordination, and I keep the momentum and optimizer the same as the client, suggesting that no drastic changes are necessary.

The optimizer remains 'AdamW' for its robustness in training. I suggest a dropout rate of 0.3; this adjustment addresses overfitting while still allowing the model to learn effectively. The batch size is set to 16, as lower-resource clients benefit from smaller batches for stability and memory management, consistent with previous practices. The local epochs are set to 2 to facilitate adequate training. For the server parameters, I decided to keep the learning rate at 0.001 as it is still within the acceptable range and has been consistently successful. The momentum remains at 0.9 for the same convergence reasons, and the optimizer continues to be 'AdamW'. The scheduler is left as 'None'. Lastly, I have set mu to 0.01, aligning it with the previous successful configurations while staying within the allowed limits.",

    "reasoning": "Since this is the first round for the client and there is no prior history to indicate the performance levels, I will adopt a cautious approach centered on typical practices in training CNNs like ResNet. Given that this is an image classification task with a moderate-capacity client, I will select a learning rate of 0.001, which is a common starting point to ensure stability during training. For weight decay, I will set it to 1e-05 to introduce some regularization without being overly restrictive initially, as it helps mitigate potential overfitting. A momentum of 0.9 is sufficient and typical for SGD, providing a balance for the optimization. I will choose the Adam optimizer since it generally performs well across a range of problems, including CNNs. The scheduler will be set to 'CosineAnnealingLR', which can aid in gradually reducing the learning rate as training progresses, potentially improving performance over time. I will set local_epochs to 2, allowing the model to learn sufficiently from the local data while still accommodating the medium-resource capability of the client. A batch size of 64 is a reasonable mid-point, offering a balance between convergence speed and memory usage. Lastly, I will set dropout_rate to 0.2 to help with overfitting while still allowing sufficient capacity for learning. For the server parameters, I will align learning rates with the client's learning rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, using the Adam optimizer as a standard practice. The scheduler will remain 'None' for simplicity since it does not directly affect server optimization. For 'mu', I will set it to 0.01 as a moderate value to provide some FedProx regularization without being too strong.",

Given the high performance with relatively conservative hyperparameters, there is room for slight optimization. Since the peer (Client 422) with a lower learning rate of 0.0004 achieved a test accuracy of 77.86%, I'll increase the learning rate for this client to 0.0008 to potentially improve performance. Increasing weight_decay to 0.0008 may assist in mitigating risks of overfitting while providing enough capacity to learn intricate patterns. Keeping the optimizer as 'AdamW', I've confirmed positive results in past trials. I will maintain local_epochs at 2, considering this has worked effectively in previous iterations. The batch_size is set to 256, which is a reasonable figure for Cluster 2’s capabilities. Lastly, I'll set the dropout_rate to 0.4, consistent with the past successful trials that utilized similar configurations without suggesting modification. For the server hyperparameters, I will keep the learning_rate to 0.001 and the optimizer as 'AdamW' as those have been effective. The server's momentum remains at 0.9 which has been working well.

    "reasoning": "Since this is the client's first round, there is no prior data on their specific performance. However, we can leverage peer history for guidance. Client 167 achieved a good accuracy (81.51%) using a learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 0.0008, and a batch size of 24. For the client, I will choose a learning rate of 0.0001 to ensure stability and avoid potential overfitting, considering the moderate resource capacity. Setting a dropout rate of 0.3, similar to peer 167's, should help prevent overfitting. Therefore, a weight decay of 0.0005 is reasonable as it lies within the acceptable range. Since support for Adam optimizer is helpful in fine-tuning and has shown good results in the past, I will use it with a momentum of 0.9, which is common in well-performing configurations. I will go with a local_epochs value of 2 since it balances training duration and learning. The batch_size will be adjusted to 32, which is reasonable given the resources. On the server side, I'll echo the client's optimizer choice and maintain a similar learning rate (0.0001) to facilitate synchronization. A momentum of 0.9 is consistent with the client's needs.

I'll opt to keep the local epochs at 2.0 to balance between convergence and resource usage. The batch size will remain at 24, but since the only allowed option is between 16 and 32, I will set it to 32 to maximize updates without exceeding compute limits. The dropout rate will stay at 0.3 as it's appropriate for balancing between overfitting and underfitting without reaching the ceiling for its constraint.

The weight decay will be set to a higher value of 0.0009 for increased regularization to combat any overfitting issues, while keeping momentum at 0.9 for stability in optimization.

Thus, for the next iteration, I will lower the learning rate further to 0.0002 to ensure stability given that this is a low-resource client (Cluster 0). Since the learning rate needs to be strictly between 0.0001 and 0.0002, I go with the maximum allowable value of 0.0002. \n\n2. The weight decay was previously set to 5e-05 without positive effect, and it should be increased to help combat potential overfitting (increasing regularization). Hence, I will set the weight decay to 0.0001, which is within the allowed range. \n\n3. The momentum will remain at 0.9, as it fits within the constraints and was part of a previously successful setup. \n\n4. The optimizer will remain 'AdamW' (as seen in history) since it seems to work well with the current setup. \n\n5. I choose to keep the dropout rate at 0.3, as increasing it could help reduce overfitting without going above the maximum of 0.5. The batch size is kept at 16, which is the maximum allowed for resource constraints. \n\n6. For the server, I will maintain the 'AdamW' optimizer and set the learning rate to 0.001 (the maximum allowed) for efficient updates across clients. The momentum of 0.9, consistent with the client-side, is appropriate. I will not introduce a scheduler to avoid additional complications for the resource-constrained clients.

Given that the task is to train ResNet18 on CIFAR10, a common strategy involves ensuring the learning rate is aggressive enough to allow quick learning but not so aggressive as to lead to instability. Therefore, I will set the learning_rate to 0.001, which is a moderate choice within allowed boundaries.\n\nConsidering the client’s ability to handle more aggressive training due to their high-resource nature, a higher dropout_rate of 0.3 will help to combat potential overfitting, especially since overfitting is a common issue with powerful models trained on relatively smaller datasets like CIFAR10. \n\nFor weight_decay, I will set it to 0.0001 to provide light regularization, which should help in maintaining a balance without causing significant underfitting. A momentum value of 0.9 is chosen, a common default that typically works well in deep learning settings. The optimizer will be AdamW, which is known for its efficiency and often provides better generalization. I will use a local_epochs setting of 2, allowing sufficient iterations for the model to converge without being too aggressive. I will set the batch_size to 64, a common size that balances training speed and stability. \n\nFor the server, I will echo the client’s learning_rate of 0.001, use the same momentum of 0.9, and select the AdamW optimizer for its advantages in momentum-based updates. Finally, for the scheduler, I will opt for 'None' as we can start without a scheduler to first assess the performance.

    "reasoning": "Given that this is the first training round for the client, we have no historical performance to indicate overfitting or underfitting directly from their own past results. However, we can leverage peer history for insights, particularly from Client 465, who achieved a good accuracy of 81.09% using a learning rate of 0.0003 and a weight decay of 0.0007. As the client is using a high-resource cluster (Cluster 2), I can suggest a slightly higher learning rate for rapid convergence, which is still within the optimal range. Therefore, I choose a learning rate of 0.0005, close to 0.0003 to maintain stability, but aggressive enough to facilitate learning. For weight decay, I will adopt the value of 0.0007 from the peer, as this should help mitigate overfitting while remaining within the acceptable constraints. The momentum will be set at 0.9, following a common best practice in image classification tasks. I choose 'AdamW' optimizer for its consistent performance with image classification models. For the scheduling strategy, I will use 'CosineAnnealingLR' based on its effectiveness in managing learning rates dynamically during training. The local_epochs are set to 2 for a reasonable compromise between training time and effective learning. The batch_size will be 128 for faster updates due to the high-resource availability.

Regarding `learning_rate`, I will start at 0.0001 to ensure stability for the low-resource client, while also complying with the guidance that suggests lower rates for weaker clients. The `weight_decay` is set to 0.0001, which is consistent with peer history while also helping mitigate potential overfitting. I will use the 'AdamW' optimizer, as it performed well for peers in the context. The `momentum` will be set at 0.9, in line with the peer's choice, as it balances velocity with convergence effectively. The recommended `local_epochs` is 2, taking from peer history for sufficient training without overloading the client's resources. Finally, I will select a `dropout_rate` of 0.3, aligned with peer usage to help prevent overfitting while ensuring sufficient model capacity. For the server parameters, I will match the `learning_rate` and `momentum` to what worked for the client: 0.001 and 0.9 respectively. I will select 'AdamW' as the optimizer since it's a strong performer for image classification tasks, and I will use 'None' for the scheduler as peers have suggested this previously without complications.

The client has been using `learning_rate` values on the edge of the constraint limits without substantial gains, so we increase it to the maximum allowable value of 0.0005 to encourage faster convergence. The `weight_decay` will be increased to 0.0005 to combat overfitting observed in their results, mirroring some successful peer strategies. The `batch_size` can be maximized to 128, suitable for their high resources and possibly yielding better representation during training. The `dropout_rate` will slightly be increased to 0.3 for better regularization and to mitigate overfitting. Given their consistent use of `AdamW`, this will be retained for optimization. On the server side, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 is appropriate for stability as it falls within the optimal range, with the same optimizer. The mu parameter will be slightly increased to 0.05, taking cues from peers to improve the effectiveness of federated training and enhance regularization.",

Given the constraints, I propose adjusting the learning_rate to 0.0002, which is close to the lower boundary (to ensure stability in low-resource clients), and weight_decay to 0.0005, which will help with potential overfitting. The momentum has been kept at 0.9 as it performed adequately and within the defined constraints. I will switch the optimizer from 'AdamW' to 'Adam' as peer Client 327 used it and achieved higher accuracy, which suggests it might work better in this scenario. I will keep the local_epochs at 2 for stability and batch_size at 16 since lower values may hinder training efficacy in a low-resource environment. A dropout_rate of 0.4 is suggested based on peer history, which shows improvement with higher dropout addressing potential overfitting issues. On the server side, I'll maintain the learning_rate at 0.001 as it aligns well with the constraints and works effectively; the optimizer will remain as 'Adam' to keep consistency with the client, and I will have the scheduling as 'None' to maintain a simple approach.

Given that `learning_rate` is critical for image classification tasks and should be balanced carefully, I opted for a learning rate of 0.001 - a moderate value that promotes cautious updates without leading to unstable training. The `weight_decay` is set to 1e-05, which aims to prevent potential overfitting without being overly restrictive. The momentum is chosen to be 0.9, a common conservative best practice that helps accelerate SGD in relevant directions and dampens oscillations. For the optimizer, I selected `AdamW`, which is suitable for datasets with small images like CIFAR10 due to its adaptive learning rate properties. The `scheduler` is set to `CosineAnnealingLR` to allow for gradual learning rate decay, which is beneficial for convergence. The `local_epochs` is set to 3, allowing for a robust number of training updates before aggregation. I chose a `batch_size` of 64, fitting within the constraints while being manageable for computation. Finally, I set the `dropout_rate` to 0.2 to mitigate overfitting effectively. \n\nFor the server parameters, I maintained the same learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 for consistency and stability during the federated updates. The choice of `AdamW` as the optimizer remains to align with client-side settings, and I kept the scheduler as `None` to simplify server-side computations.

The weight decay is set to 0.0001, which provides a reasonable level of regularization to combat overfitting. Utilizing 'AdamW' as the optimizer is retained since it has shown effectiveness in previous attempts. I am keeping the momentum at 0.9, which has proven effective. The dropout rate is suggested to remain at 0.3 to help mitigate any overfitting while remaining stable. For local epochs, I recommend keeping it constant at 2.0, as that has been a consistent setting. The batch size of 16 is necessary to support the low-resource setting, while also taking into account the recent performances of peers and the balance needed for training efficiency. The server's parameters remain consistent with the client's learning from previous rounds and include a learning rate of 0.0001, which is the minimum needed for decently paced learning as indicated by prior client models and the appropriate 'AdamW' optimizer.

    "reasoning": "The client's recent test accuracies show a decline, with the latest epoch at 62.25%, indicating potential underfitting rather than overfitting. To address this, we can slightly increase the `learning_rate` to encourage faster convergence, staying within the strict constraint range of 0.0001 to 0.0005. Therefore, I will set it to 0.0003. This is also supported by past guidance suggesting that low accuracies can benefit from higher learning rates. The `weight_decay` will be set at 0.0005; this is a moderate value that helps in regularization but does not excessively penalize the weights, allowing for learning without overfitting. The `momentum` remains at 0.9, aligning with previous successful configurations. The optimizer will stay as 'AdamW', which is a robust choice given the historical usage. I will recommend increasing the `local_epochs` to 3 to facilitate more learning across the data in one local training session. The `batch_size` will remain as 32; this seems to be an effective size based on previous results. Lastly, the `dropout_rate` will be increased to 0.4 to provide additional regularization against overfitting, which should help in improving generalization on the test set. For the server configuration, I will maintain the same settings as before since they have shown stability and effectiveness: `learning_rate` stays at 0.001, `momentum` is 0.9, and the `optimizer` remains 'AdamW' with no scheduler needed. Finally, `mu` is kept at 0.01, allowing for effective regularization in the federated setup without significantly changing from last setup.",

This indicates that the learning rate may be at the upper limit of the optimal range but has not caused notable deterioration in performance, suggesting it can be adjusted downward to further stabilize learning. Reducing the learning rate to 0.001 may help in refining the model's performance without risking underfitting, considering the test accuracies of previous epoch settings. Additionally, the dropout rate has been increased to 0.4 in the past, which likely led to the observed model performance; however, since this exceeds the specified range of 0.3, I will reduce it to 0.3 to allow for regularization without loss of data. The batch size will remain at 128, as the client has the capability to handle it, and it has previously contributed positively to the learning process. With respect to the server-side parameters, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 aligns with the client settings and previous findings, ensuring consistency in performance across different nodes.

To address possible overfitting since the last test accuracy remains unchanged, I'll maintain a higher dropout_rate of 0.4 (inspired by peer 250) to promote generalization.

Since the client is low-resource, I suggest a slightly lower learning rate of 0.0001 (the minimum allowed), keeping the history in mind. This aligns with the guidance of using a lower learning rate when aiming for stable training. For weight_decay, I recommend the same value of 0.0005 as it has worked satisfactorily in the past. The momentum will remain at 0.9 as optimal for stability, with the AdamW optimizer being the client's choice consistently. The local_epochs of 2 is reasonable for low-resource clients and I will keep the batch_size at 16. The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.3, as it has balanced overfitting and performance. On the server side, I propose a learning_rate of 0.0005, which has previously yielded optimal results without promoting instability. The momentum of 0.9 and AdamW optimizer will remain unchanged, retaining the existing strategy that has led to decent test accuracy.

    "reasoning": "Given that the client's last recorded performance achieved a test accuracy of 80.13%, we want to maintain the momentum and adapt hyperparameters to possibly improve on this. The client had a learning rate of 0.001, which is already high for their specified range (0.0001 to 0.0005). To minimize the risk of overfitting while maintaining the ability to learn effectively, it will be prudent to lower the learning rate to 0.0005. The weight decay was set at 0.0001, and I suggest increasing it to 0.0005 to introduce more regularization, as this can help combat potential overfitting indicated by the significant gap between train and test accuracies. Keeping momentum at 0.9 is optimal given it's within preferred parameters, and it assists in stabilizing the training process. The optimizer 'AdamW' remains the best choice for managing the learning rates well. A local epoch of 2 is reasonable, and I will retain the batch size at 64 since it has previously worked well. Furthermore, the dropout rate is adjusted up to 0.4 to help generalization against any overfitting. For the server, I will use the same settings as the client to retain consistency in learning dynamics since the client is high resource, and their performance was solid, maintaining the learning rate at 0.001 allows for further optimization without risking instability. Lastly, mu will be set to 0.01, within the boundaries for moderate levels of FedProx regularization.",

Given the constraints and the moderate capacity of the client, maintaining a low learning rate is crucial. The previously used learning rate of 0.001 is at the upper limit of the allowed range. To avoid potential overfitting while still enabling effective learning, I recommend reducing the learning rate slightly to 0.0005, which can help improve the model's generalization. As for weight decay, increasing it to 0.0005 will provide additional regularization, countering any signs of overfitting as indicated by the relatively high train accuracy versus test accuracy. Maintaining the momentum at 0.9 is consistent with previous values and should enhance convergence. The optimizer 'AdamW' was previously used and is effective, so this setting is retained. For the scheduler, keeping 'CosineAnnealingLR' is advisable for effective learning rate scheduling. I also recommend setting the local epochs to 2, as it balances the need for model updates with the client's capabilities. The batch size remains at 32, which is viable given the medium-resource context, although I've adjusted it slightly to one of the strict options by choosing 24.

Client 15 used a learning_rate of 0.001 and achieved an accuracy of 81.96%, which indicates that this value is likely effective. Given the weight_decay of 0.0005 worked for a peer, we will use this value as well, keeping in mind that higher weight_decay can help with overfitting in case that's an issue. We'll set momentum to 0.9 as this is a common and effective choice in practice. The optimizer used by peers was AdamW, which works well for image tasks and we'll select it to ensure compatibility with the currently used model. We can afford to use a larger batch_size, so we will set it to 128, and choose 2 local_epochs to provide a good balance between training and overfitting risks. Finally, we will set the dropout_rate to 0.3 based on peer usage; it can help regularize the model without being too aggressive, and considering the task complexity, it should prevent overfitting effectively. For the server, we will replicate the learning_rate, momentum, and optimizer choices used by the client which help in consistency and stability, and we will select 'None' for the scheduler as there are no previous settings requiring adjustments.

Given that the client achieved a test accuracy of 79.01% with their previous hyperparameters, it indicates that while there may be some level of performance, there could be room for improvement. The peer (Client 15) achieving 81.96% suggests that slight adjustments could yield better results.\n\nThe current learning rate of 0.001 is on the higher side, so I will reduce it to 0.0005 to avoid overfitting, especially since the test accuracy indicates potential overfitting (the performance isn't significantly better than peers but still above the training performance). I will suggest a weight decay increase to enhance regularization, setting it to 0.0005 to control for possible overfitting.\n\nThe momentum will be kept at 0.9, as this has been typical in the client and peer histories, aiding convergence without diverging. The optimizer remains as AdamW; it has been successful in their past attempts and is better suited for most scenarios in CNNs. I will keep the batch size at 128, as this is manageable for high-resource clients while also fitting within established parameters. Lastly, I will adjust dropout rate to 0.4 to help mitigate overfitting further during training, considering the history of overfitting in similar models. For the server parameters, I will maintain the learning rate at the same level (0.001) since it is still effective and ensure stability in updates. I will keep the momentum to 0.9 and use AdamW as the optimizer to align with the client's setup, maintaining consistency across rounds.

The client's learning rate of 0.0001 is on the lower end and appropriate for their low-resource capacity; however, given the strong performance previously, I will maintain it at this level but suggest utilizing the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler to potentially enhance training over epochs. The batch size of 16 is optimal; it fits the low-resource nature, and lower batch sizes help with stability. I recommend maintaining a dropout rate of 0.3 to prevent overfitting further, as the model's performance suggests it may be on the edge of overfitting. As the training accuracy is not reported, I will uphold `weight_decay` at 0.0005, which is a reasonable balance for regularization without being excessively conservative.\n\nFor the server parameters, I will keep the values equal to the client's to ensure consistency across training; thus I will also maintain the learning rate at 0.0001. The optimizer stays as AdamW, and to improve training dynamics, the rate is already optimized at 0.9 for momentum.

I'll keep weight_decay the same at 0.0005 for regularization, as it has shown satisfactory results. The momentum will remain at 0.9, which is a balanced choice. I'll opt for 'Adam' for simplicity in low-resource clients, as 'SGD' might require more tuning and typically heavier computations.

The latter indicates a more stable performance as it approaches good accuracy, suggesting that a smaller learning rate is beneficial. Since both accuracies were relatively low initially, this context also indicates that maintaining a lower learning rate is prudent. The peer history also noticed improvements with lower learning rates, as seen with Client 335 achieving 81.86% with a learning rate of 0.0001. Given that weight decay has been previously set at 0.0005 with some good results, a slight adjustment to 0.0006 for regularization might allow for better generalization. The batch size is maximized at 16, which fits client capacity, and dropout was effective in reducing overfitting (with a previous increase to 0.3 resulting in better performance). Therefore, I will increase it to 0.4 to further combat any potential overfitting.

The initial learning rates of 0.001 and 0.0005 produced satisfactory results, whereas a drop in performance was observed with a further reduced learning rate of 0.0003. Given the guidance that low learning rates can result in underfitting, I will select a learning rate of 0.0002 for the client to increase the model's responsiveness. Regarding the weight decay, since previous tests showed variability in performance, I will set this to 0.0001, which has previously been effective. The dropout rate will be maintained at 0.3 to prevent overfitting, particularly since the model's performance was not as expected at higher dropout rates. Retaining the momentum at 0.9 aligns with the effective historical settings. A batch size of 48 is chosen to comply with the available options. A local epoch of 3 is maintained as it has been used consistently. The server will have a learning rate of 0.001 which has been effective per the peer history, a momentum of 0.9 to match the client’s approach, and will utilize 'None' for the scheduler for simplicity and stability in regularization.

Client 369 achieved a significant accuracy of 78.27% with the following hyperparameters. Since the learning_rate of 0.0003 was effective for them, I will use the same value for the client. This value is conservative and fits well within the allowed range. A weight_decay of 0.0001 is also utilized as it offers regularization without being too restrictive, reflecting the peer's choice. The momentum is set to 0.9, a standard choice that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations, again matching the successful client’s strategy. The optimizer will be 'AdamW', a popular choice for image classification that balances performance and speed. I will use the 'CosineAnnealingLR' scheduler as it can help the model converge more efficiently, as seen in peer experimentation. The local_epochs will be set to 3 to allow the model to train adequately despite being a medium-resource client. For the batch_size, I’m opting for 64, balancing the trade-off between stability and efficiency. Finally, the dropout_rate is set to 0.3, striking a balance between enhancing generalization and maintaining enough capacity to learn effectively from the data. On the server-side, I will replicate the learning_rate of 0.0003 and the same momentum (0.9) and optimizer ('AdamW') for consistency. The scheduler remains 'None' as it simplifies server-side operations given client dependencies.

However, given that a high learning rate could potentially lead to underfitting or a failure to converge properly in future training epochs, I recommend a lower learning rate in line with the constraints. The peer client achieved a lower accuracy (78.27%) but with the same learning rate; thus, I will experiment with a further reduced learning rate of 0.0002. The weight decay for both clients has been consistent at 0.0001, which has shown effectiveness without causing significant overfitting, so I will retain this value. A slight increase in dropout rate to 0.3 is warranted here, as comparative analysis shows that it can help prevent overfitting without drastically affecting the model's ability to learn. The batch size I am adjusting to 32 due to the medium-resource capacity of the client, which can accommodate this without hampering performance. Momentum will remain at 0.9, as it is a stable choice seen in both the client and peer histories. For the server, I will keep the learning rate at 0.0003 for consistency with previous rounds.

The peer client 369 achieved a high accuracy (78.27%) with a learning rate of 0.0003, prompting me to recommend values close to this for the client too. A learning rate of 0.0003 keeps the training stable without risking overshoot during updates. The weight decay is set to 0.0001 as it is commonly used for generalization in CNN models, balancing the need for regularization without overly restricting learning. The momentum value of 0.9 is effective for optimizing training speed and convergence. The AdamW optimizer gives good performance for image classification tasks, offering adaptive learning rates. A local epoch setting of 2 allows for a sufficiently deep training without overfitting. A batch size of 64 is a suitable default for medium-resource clients like this one, allowing an adequate gradient estimate without excessive memory use. A dropout rate of 0.3 provides regularization to address potential overfitting without significantly impacting capacity. On the server side, mirroring the client with the same learning rate, momentum, and optimizer settings can help maintain stability across clients, while using 'CosineAnnealingLR' as the scheduler prepares the model to adjust learning rates dynamically, which is beneficial for convergence.

I will suggest lowering the `learning_rate` to 0.0002 to stabilize the training process, as seen in both client and peer history where `0.0003` appears to be somewhat high for the current performance. Increasing the `weight_decay` to 0.0005 helps to combat overfitting, given that the model is not maximally saturated yet. The `momentum` will stay at 0.9 since it's known to work well and fits within the required range. Additionally, I will maintain the `AdamW` optimizer, as it has performed well previously. The `scheduler` will remain as `CosineAnnealingLR`, which tends to enhance learning rate adjustments effectively in image classification tasks. The `local_epochs` will be set to 2 as it's in between 1 and 3, which often expedites convergence while not overstraining capacity given the medium-resource client profile. The `batch_size` of 64 will be retained due to its successful usage in prior epochs.

Since both training and testing accuracies are close, it is crucial to ensure that we do not significantly alter parameters that could destabilize the training process. The learning rate should be lowered slightly to prevent potential overfitting, so I suggest setting it to 0.0002, which is still on the higher side of the provided constraint. Weight decay is also increased to 0.0002 to combat potential overfitting as it aligns with the guidelines provided.
